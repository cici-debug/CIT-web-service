											Documentation
											[block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "Base64 type" } [/block] Remember the base64 you send via this API call should be padded. Which means it should begin with something like this: "data:text/csv;base64,<actual_file_data>" **data:text/csv** should be the format of the file you are uploading. [block:callout] { "type": "info", "title": "Tip: Uploading photo IDs?", "body": "JPEG is the preferred file type for these images." } [/block] [block:callout] { "type": "danger", "title": "Deprecated", "body": "This API call is being deprecated for a more awesome [API call](doc:adding-documents)." } [/block]
