					Review the transaction codes below to get a better understanding of the status updates for transactions. Please make sure you have set up [Subscriptions](doc:subscriptions) to receive these updates as they occur. Alternatively, you can also use [GET transaction](doc:transaction) to check status periodically (Not Recommended). > Please pay attention to `timeline` & `recent_status` keys in the json response. The `note` field would contain a transaction code. Below is a list of the transaction codes. ## Queue Codes [block:parameters] { "data": { "h-0": "Code", "h-1": "Description", "0-0": "Q01", "0-1": "Test transactions not allowed on production", "1-0": "Q02", "5-0": "Q03", "9-0": "Q04", "9-1": "More information needed on sender: supply utility bill", "5-1": "More information needed on receiver: any supply Government Issued Photo ID", "1-1": "More information needed on sender: supply any Government Issued Photo ID", "10-0": "Q05", "11-0": "Q06", "12-0": "Q07", "13-0": "Q08", "14-0": "Q09", "15-0": "Q10", "27-0": "Q46", "28-0": "Q47", "29-0": "Q48", "30-0": "Q49", "31-0": "Q50", "10-1": "More information needed on receiver: supply utility bill", "11-1": "KYC (i.e. know your customer) steps unfinished on sender", "12-1": "KYC unfinished on receiver", "13-1": "Sending node locked", "14-1": "Receiving node locked", "15-1": "High risk transaction (e.g. the account does not contain enough funds to process the full transaction amount)", "27-1": "Sender not authorized to make transactions", "28-1": "Receiver not authorized to make transactions", "29-1": "Sender on screenings list", "30-1": "Receiver on screenings list", "31-1": "Unable to process the transaction (reason undisclosed)", "2-0": "Q02-A", "2-1": "More information needed on sender: supply Passport", "3-0": "Q02-B", "3-1": "More information needed on sender: supply Drivers License", "6-0": "Q03-A", "6-1": "More information needed on receiver: supply Passport", "7-0": "Q03-B", "7-1": "More information needed on receiver: supply Drivers License", "4-0": "Q02-C", "4-1": "More information needed on sender: Finish KBA (Knowledge Based Authentication)", "8-0": "Q03-C", "8-1": "More information needed on receiver: Finish KBA", "16-0": "Q10-A", "17-0": "Q10-B", "18-0": "Q10-C", "19-0": "Q10-D", "20-0": "Q10-E", "21-0": "Q10-F", "22-0": "Q10-G", "23-0": "Q10-H", "24-0": "Q10-I", "25-0": "Q10-J", "24-1": "Possible duplicate transaction.
