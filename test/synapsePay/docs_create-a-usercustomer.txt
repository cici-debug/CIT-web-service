											[block:image] { "images": [ { "image": [] } ] } [/block] ## Searching for users You can also search for users by email or name. Here is an example [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "curl -X GET -H \"X-SP-GATEWAY: client_id_2bb1e412edd311e6bd04e285d6015267|client_secret_2bb1e714edd311e6bd04e285d6015267\" -H \"X-SP-USER-IP: 127.0.0.1\" -H \"X-SP-USER: |e716990e50b67a1177736960b6357524b22090ccab093d068b3d7a18dbde3f4c\" \"https://sandbox.synapsepay.com/api/3/users?query=bryan\"", "language": "curl" } ] } [/block] ## Pagination Responses are paginated, so to move through pages, add **page** as a GET parameter.
