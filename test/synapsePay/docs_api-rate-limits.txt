					[Rate limiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting) of the API is primarily considered on a per-user basis â€” or more accurately described, per `oauth_key` in your control. If a method allows for 20 requests per rate limit window, then it allows you to make 20 requests per window per leveraged oauth_key. Currently rate limits are **100 requests per minute per user**. In case of [OAuth](doc:oauth-resources) & [Update User](doc:update-user), rate limits are **10 requests per minute per user**.
