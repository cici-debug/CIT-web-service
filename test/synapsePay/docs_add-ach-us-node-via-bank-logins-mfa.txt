											[block:callout] { "type": "info", "title": "MFAs", "body": "MFAs can be triggered once or multiple times. So please handle the logic with the exception of getting multiple MFAs for every bank login attempt. \n\nEven when banks send multiple MFA questions, they will do so one at a time. It is recommended that you send an answer back for the first question and then re-check the response for an http code of 202, which means another MFA question was sent. Cycle through the questions in this way until http code is 200." } [/block]
