								The Zapbook is Zapier's directory of apps. Every app has a landing page on it, and users can find all of your published Zaps there, as well as see a list of your available Triggers and Actions. The Zaps shown at the top of the list are a function of popularity and usage, helping people find the most useful examples first.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Your Zapbook page URL is in this format:
							Element:a
								https://zapier.com/zapbook/todoist/
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Every
							Element:em
								pair
								of apps also has a Zapbook page automatically. Just follow up your Zapbook link with another app's slug, like this:
							Element:a
								https://zapier.com/zapbook/trello/google-sheets/
								. You're guaranteed a landing page no matter what app, with these, and any Zap templates you have will show up appropriately. Another advantage is that if you don't have a Zap template for that specific app pair, we'll try to show the most similar Zaps you do have.

								There are several advantages to embedding your Zaps on your site/app:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Users can see examples of the most popular use-cases, or the ones you want to recommend, easily
							Element:li
								Zap setup happens in a pop-up when people click an embedded Zap
							Element:li
								People are less likely to give up looking for solutions when these are presented as examples
							Element:li
								Dynamic Zap lists will keep updating themselves as new Zaps are introduced or fixed
							Element:li
								You'll start receiving statistics on Zap usage from embedded Zaps

											Problems with document.write on load?
											Add this parameter with any ID you want:
										Element:code
											html_id=
											. Then you'll want to have the embeds inside a div with the same id—this will cause the embeds to load with the div, and not with document.write as they do otherwise. Example:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:code
											<div id=foo> <script src="https://zapier.com/zapbook/embed/widget.js?services=mailchimp&container=true&limit=10&html_id=foo"></script> </div>
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In some cases, we've seen an issue with clicking an embed not properly opening the Zapier modal. If that happens, try pasting this code snipped into the chrome developer console and re-clicking. If that works, then just include the snippet in a script tag at the bottom of your html body.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											function zapierOpenDialog(e) { e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation(); var button = e.target; window.open(button.getAttribute('data-popup-href'), 'zapierModalWindow', 'toolbar=no,location=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=980,height=700'); return false; };
