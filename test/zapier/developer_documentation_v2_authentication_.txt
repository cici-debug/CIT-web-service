					Your API probably has some kind of authentication needs in order for us to talk to it on behalf of a user. Zapier supports the following authentication schemes: Basic Auth, Digest Auth, API Keys or OAuth V2.

								Classic Basic Auth, where users provide Zapier their username and password to authenticate with your API. This is also the scheme you want to use if your API relies on Basic Auth, but with atypical values for the username and password. For instance, an API that uses an API Key as the username and a dummy value as the password would still want to select Basic Auth for their App.

								Typically, you'll provide your users with an API Key inside your app somewhere. Many times these are provided on the user's settings or accounts page. These keys can be given to Zapier by the user so that we may make authenticated requests to access that user's information on their behalf.
