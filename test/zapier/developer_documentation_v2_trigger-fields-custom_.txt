					Sometimes, the data returned by a trigger is hard to use in a Zap because of how the keys are named. When a user goes to map fields in an action, the trigger data's keys are used to identify which field is which. If those keys are something unintelligible like UUIDs rather than human-readable data points like
				Element:code
					"name"
					or
				Element:code
					"email"
					, the user may not be able to identify which fields to map in their action.

					To remedy this, we have Custom Trigger Fields, an additional HTTP GET to a URL you provide in your trigger definition that tells us additional metadata about the data the trigger will return, such as human-readable labels to display when mapping fields. All you need to do to enable custom trigger fields is:
			Node:
			(type) c

				Element:ul
				Element:li
					Provide a
				Element:code
					Custom Trigger Fields URL Route
					for the trigger in question.
				Element:li
					Ensure the URL route returns data in the below format, or manipulate to fit with
				Element:a
