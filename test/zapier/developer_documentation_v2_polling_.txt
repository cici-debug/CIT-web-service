					Polling is the process of repeatedly hitting the same endpoint looking for new data. We don't like doing this (its wasteful), vendors don't like us doing it (again, its wasteful) and users dislike it (they have to wait a maximum interval to trigger on new data). However, it is the one method that is ubiquitous, so we support it.
