								The most important thing is to not make breaking changes. Zapier performs some automated checks to this regard but you'll want to be very careful changing things like:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
								The data model that is exposed for triggers.
							Element:li
								Scripting to transform or add custom logic.
						Node:

							Element:p
								In general it's safe to add something new and dangerous to change existing functionality. We recommend versioning your triggers and actions and hiding legacy versions. This way old Zaps still function but new users can use the new versions.
