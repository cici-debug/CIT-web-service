							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Apps can now have
							Element:a
								Searches
								. A Search is used to find individual records by a field (say finding a contact by name).
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Searches can be linked with Actions to create a
							Element:a
								Search or Create
								flow, giving the user a way to search for an item, and if it doesn't exist, create it.
							Element:li
								Searches can be used to power action fields, similar to Dynamic Dropdowns. Users input data to the field which is used to search for items, and a given data element returned from the search result (such as
							Element:code
								id
								) is used in place of their input.
							Element:li
								Fields can now have the “List” property defined through the UI. Before this was only possible to set via Scripting.
							Element:li
								Action fields have a “Parent Key” option that enables line item support.
							Element:li
								Fields now have a "Placeholder" option that operates solely as an HTML5 style placeholder - it is only for helping the user understand what will happen if they enter nothing in the given field.
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Breaking Change
								Scripting can no longer access
							Element:code
								trigger_data
								from
							Element:code
								bundle
								in
							Element:code
								pre_write
								and
							Element:code
								post_write
								.
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Breaking Change
								Scripting can no longer access
							Element:code
								trigger
								and
							Element:code
								action
								from
							Element:code
								bundle.zap
								.
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Breaking Change
								Scripting code now runs under JS strict mode (
							Element:code
								'use strict';
								), so developer should verify their code still executes correctly (the built in code editor runs jshint - so check there!)
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Breaking Change
								Data mapped into Action Fields is always coerced according to the field's type
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Breaking Change
								Data entering actions is no longer flattened into a string. This means lists and dictionaries will pass through to actions intact rather than being converted to CSV and 'key|value' respectively. If there is existing Scripting code that does any sort of parsing on those values, it will need to be updated to handle the new structure (likely this means deleting code that was expanding the strings back into arrays and dictionaries).
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Breaking Change
								We now automatically include a
							Element:code
								state
								parameter on the Authorization URL for apps that use OAuth2.
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Bug Fix
								Trigger fields passed into custom fields, REST hook and catch hook methods are always coerced according to the field's type
