								If you plan to add an app that anyone can use, your primary motivation should be user retention and satisfaction. You should already have users asking for integrations.

								Zapier is not a distribution platform. We drive few new users back to individual apps. If your primary motivation for adding an app to Zapier is to gain users, stop now: you'll be disappointed by the results.

								Before you begin development, you'll want to plan out what triggers and actions to build. If you haven't yet, please read
							Element:a
								How Zapier Works
								and set up a few Zaps to get a sense of the user experience.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Building on the Zapier platform is different from other app platforms in the sense that you'll be creating discrete triggers and actions instead of defining an entire app's end-to-end user experience.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								However, it is similar in the sense that end user experience still matters
							Element:strong
								a lot
								. Simply pointing triggers and actions at your public API endpoints isn't enough. You'll want to strongly consider which triggers and actions your app will support to start and what the user experience looks like while setting up a Zap that includes your trigger or action.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The most successful platform apps on Zapier only have a few (2 or 3) triggers and actions to start. You can always add more over time as users request them. If you need help figuring out what might be useful to your users, you can browse the
							Element:a
								Zapbook
								for similar apps and see what triggers and actions are supported.

											The

											Style Guide

											Within a day or so after any necessary changes are complete (and re-submitted) we push the app Global. It takes about 24 hours for an app to be fully Global once we throw the switch. We'll reach out to let you know when we do this.
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:p
											Every global app has a Zapbook landing page (ex.
										Element:a
											Evernote

										Element:em

											We consider an app to be in Beta until there are approximately 20 live users on it (ideally, most of them from your userbase, not staff). A "Beta" tag will appear above your app logo on Zapier during this time.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											During that time we will keep an eye on usage to check that customers are having a good experience with setting up and running Zaps. We keep a close watch on support feedback during this time, too. At the start of this phase we'll expect you to create help docs and 8 Zap templates using your app: These baseline materials are required for every public app on Zapier.

											In order to complete your activation, you will need to submit your help docs to us.
									Node:
									(type) c

											You'll only need to submit info for your app's "How to get started" copy and screenshots via our form, only plain unformatted text is needed and the screenshots we request. The formatting and all the other parts of the documentation are automatically generated by us.
									Node:
									(type) c

											To submit your documentation to us,
										Element:a
											please fill in this form here.
									Node:

											Please note that it will take a few moments and you will need to provide some screenshots. It is also really important to select the correct "auth type" when you are filling the form in. If you choose the wrong type you may need to resubmit your docs to us. If you have any questions about this form, please feel free to
										Element:a
											drop us a message

											#
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											External testing and refinements during the Beta period are natural and necessary for an app's success. We ask for 20 users before considering an app out of Beta because your primary goal with Zapier should be retention. Your first users and testers should be drawn from your internal userbase—we recommend surveys and blog posts with embedded Zaps to capture interest while still in Beta, as well as reaching out to all those who have expressed interest in integrations.

					Apps are in Beta until they have approximately 20 live users.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					External testing and refinements during the Beta period are necessary to ensure your app's success. We ask for 20 users before considering an app out of Beta because your primary goal with Zapier should be retention: Your first users and testers should be drawn from your internal user base—we recommend surveys and blog posts with embedded Zaps to capture interest while still in Beta, as well as reaching out to all those who have expressed interest in integrations.

We’ll feature the Zap templates you create in your launch post. They are also embeddable on your app with a small snippet of javascript and should be used wherever possible—they enable your users to create Zaps without ever navigating away from your app. Read the

					Pitching the tech press, industry publications, and local business news reporters helps spread the word as well and will often get picked up by news sites and automated SaaS news aggregators. Some good examples of past press releases around new integrations:
				Element:a
					Google Slides
					,
				Element:a
					RingCentral
					,
				Element:a
					ShipStation
					,
				Element:a
					WordSmith

					It helps to have a PR firm to help increase the reach of your releases, but a good general tip if you don't have one is to build a very targeted list of journalists and publications that cover the topic, and reach out to them with your article. Persistence pays off here, since it's likely only some will be able to cover it. It also helps to maintain those ongoing relationships, and tailor the language in your outreach to their interests.
			Node:

				Element:p

					Note: While we would like to team up with each new partner on this activity, the volume of partners prevents us from doing so as our press contacts have even frankly asked us, "Don't you launch a new integration every day?" This activity is most impactful when it comes from your side.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Another angle you might try is targeted paid promotion of your integration. Facebook, for example, offers the option to "Boost" content—like a link to your blog post about the integration—to a targeted audience. There are Facebook audiences of people interested in pages related to, for example, marketing automation, that may be receptive to your news, too.

					Your app is now more powerful than ever, thanks to integration possibilities with other partners. Reach out to them for shared promotion - For example,

					TimeCamp
					reached out to other apps to get exposure via blog posts.

					Whenever a Zap is applicable to something we’re writing about on the blog, we might embed a template. Having more useful Zap templates helps you cover a wide range of applications! Popular Zap templates often get featured inside other partner apps through our dynamic embedding widget. This means exposure to other partners’ user-bases because their Zap template uses your app.

					The data model that is exposed for triggers.
				Element:li
					Scripting to transform or add custom logic.
			Node:

					In general it's safe to add something new and dangerous to change existing functionality. We recommend versioning your triggers and actions and hiding legacy versions. This way old Zaps still function but new users can use the new versions.
