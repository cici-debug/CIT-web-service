					Anyone can add an app to Zapier, usually without writing any new code. This quick guide will familiarize you with the Zapier Developer Platform and get you pointed in the right direction building your own app. When you're finished, you’ll be able to use the app in your own Zapier account, share it privately with others, or even
				Element:a
					submit your app to be available globally
					to anyone with a Zapier account. Plus, you'll have integrations with the 750+ apps on our platform instantly.

								Building a Zapier app requires connecting an API to our Developer Platform. Essentially, the platform shows us how to translate the way you access and update data within your app into Zapier terms. Most Zapier apps include include
							Element:em
								Triggers
								(reading new data from an app) and
							Element:em
								Actions
								(writing data to an app), using
							Element:em
								authentication
								from the end user so the data is specific to their account.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Depending on your app, you may have only triggers or actions. Zapier's end-users build workflows with these Triggers and Actions. A Trigger is the event we watch for that kicks off a workflow, and an Action is the task we complete on their behalf.

								A Zapier app with authentication, a Trigger, and an Action is a great start! If you’re ready to enhance your Zapier app, consider adding a couple more Triggers or Actions. Our
							Element:a
								style guide
								recommends starting with no more than three of each, so choose the most common ways people use your app.

								Want to make your Zapier app available globally to any user? Now would be a good time to
							Element:a
								review the app lifecycle
								to get an idea for what’s needed to make you most successful. Once your app is public, we’ll work with you to
							Element:a
								launch your app
								with co-marketing to support your app’s newfound superpowers.
