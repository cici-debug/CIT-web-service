								Trigger Fields
								answer the question:

								How can a user filter Triggers?
								Almost exclusively these are
							Element:a
								dynamic dropdowns
								, but some real world examples are:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Search Term
							Element:em
								(EG: Twitter Tweet Search)
							Element:li
								Label
							Element:em
								(EG: Gmail Inbox)
							Element:li
								Parent Object
							Element:em
								(span relationships via
							Element:a
								dynamic dropdowns
								)
							Element:li
								Repo for an Issue
							Element:em
								(EG: Github)
							Element:li
								Notebook for a Note
							Element:em

								Imagine an endpoint like
							Element:code
								https://example.com/api/v1/prospects.json
								- that would require no trigger fields at all. However an endpoint like
							Element:code
								https://example.com/api/v1/list/1234/prospects.json
								- that would require at least a trigger field to select the list ID (and it would be a
							Element:a
								dynamic dropdown
								at that!).

											A default value for a field. The behavior varies between required and optional fields. For required fields, the default will be set once when the user first creates the Trigger, but it is not guaranteed after that (we raise an error on missing/null values instead). For optional fields, it is set on initial creation and used in place of missing or null values every time the Zap runs.

											Use an existing

											to load in values for selection, using the machine readable value your API consumes (like
										Element:code
											id
											or
										Element:code
											hash
											) while showing a human readable version to the user (like
										Element:code

											or

											).

									Node:
