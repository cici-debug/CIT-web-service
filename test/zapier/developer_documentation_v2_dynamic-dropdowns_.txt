					Sometimes, API endpoints require clients to specify a parent object in order to create or access the child resources. Imagine having to specify a company id in order to get a list of employees for that company. Since people don't speak in auto-incremented ID's, it is necessary that Zapier offer a simple way to select that parent using human readable handles.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Our solution is to present users a dropdown that is populated by making a live API call to fetch a list of
				Element:em
					parent
					objects. We call these special dropdowns
				Element:strong
					dynamic dropdowns
					.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:blockquote
				Element:p
					Tip: We used to call the dynamic dropdowns "prefills"!
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Here is what a user sees as a dynamic dropdown:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
				Element:img
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					In order for a dynamic dropdown to work, we must have a working
				Element:a
					trigger
					set up for the parent object. Zapier will query for that dynamic dropdown, parse out an identifier and a human readable handle for each record, and then offer the user a dropdown. Once they make a selection, we store the identifier for use later when reading or writing child objects.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The dynamic dropdown syntax is split into three parts:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
					Which trigger is this dynamic dropdown referring to?
				Element:li
					Which piece of data is the unique identifier?
				Element:li
					Which piece of data is a human readable representation?
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					We combine those into one field:
				Element:code
					TRIGGERKEY.identifier_key.human_readable_key
					.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					For example, let's say you have a trigger called Project which offers the following data (remember, triggers are expected to return a list of JSON objects with an ID field):
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:span
					[
				Element:span
					{
				Element:span
					"id"
				Element:span
					:
				Element:span
					4287243
				Element:span
					,
				Element:span
					"owner_id"
				Element:span
					:
				Element:span
					4632
				Element:span
					,
				Element:span
					"date_created"
				Element:span
					:
				Element:span
					"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 16:41:54 -0400"
				Element:span
					,
				Element:span
					"title"
				Element:span
					:
				Element:span
					"My secret project!"
				Element:span
					,
				Element:span
					"description"
				Element:span
					:
				Element:span
					"It's a Facebook for dogs!"
				Element:span
					}
				Element:span
					...
				Element:span
					]
			Node:
			(type) c

				Element:p
					You want to let users read just the messages from that project as a trigger. As you are making the
				Element:strong
					message trigger
					you'd need to create a
				Element:code
					project
				Element:a
					trigger field
					with the following dynamic dropdown value:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Example:
				Element:br
				Element:code
					new_project.id.title
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:blockquote
				Element:p
					Note:
				Element:code
					new_project
					is a fictional key for the Project trigger. You'll set your specific trigger key when you create your trigger.
				Element:code
					id
					is the identifier from the above project data. The human readable representation key
				Element:code
					title
					is located there as well.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Notice that a dynamic dropdown is really nothing more than a
					â†‘ Was this documentation useful?
				Element:a
					trigger field
					/
				Element:a
					action field
					that is populated by another trigger.
