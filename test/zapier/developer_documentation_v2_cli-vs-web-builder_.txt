					Everyone has a different comfort level with development tools. That's why we offer two ways to interact with the Zapier Developer Platform: the Command Line Interface and the Web Builder.

					Both enable you to expose your app to Zapier users by connecting your API to our auth, trigger, action, and search structure, and the two interfaces are geared towards different technical levels and organizational needs.

								The Command Line Interface (CLI) to the Zapier Developer Platform is based on Node JS. Engineers—or those with high technical skills—describe their apps using a JavaScript definition format. Functions you write call Zapier’s helper libraries to receive inputs from a user’s Zap and pass back outputs from your app.

								Most of the apps you see on Zapier were built using the User Interface (UI) to the Zapier Developer Platform. A good number of those apps have been built by non-developers. Even if you don't write code on a day-to-day basis, you should be able to get an app up and running if you have a solid understanding of APIs.
