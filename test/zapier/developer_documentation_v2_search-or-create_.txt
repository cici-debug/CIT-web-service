					Search or Create allows users to combine your Searches and your Actions together into one flow. Each Search may be associated with one Action, which represents the creation of the same type of object that search is used to look up. (Practical example
				Element:a
					here
					)

					Example use cases might include:

				Element:ul
				Element:li
					Find or create a new customer
				Element:em
					(EG: Salesforce)
				Element:li
					Notebook for a Note

					The user's UI is built using a combination of the
				Element:code
					label
					above and the related
				Element:code
					label
					and
				Element:code
					noun
					from the single Search and Action.

					At this point, when the user selects the checkbox to do a Find or Create, they will be given the option to fill in both the fields for the search, as well as the fields for the create.

					When the Zap runs, if an element is found during the Search, it will be used. If not, a new item will be created.

					Errors like a 404 will not be interpreted as a "miss" on search and will not trigger a follow up create - explicitly return
				Element:code
					[]
					when no records are found. If your API can't do that, use scripting to return an empty list
				Element:code
					[]
					(note a
				Element:code
					_post_search
					won't work, you'll have to replace
				Element:code
					_search
					completely)

					This type of connection should be used in cases where the search is likely to yield one correct result, and unlikely to yield incorrect results. Good use cases include searching by keys like
				Element:code
					email
					or
				Element:code
					phone number
					, or other uniquely identifying information that the user might have.
