								Apps are in Beta until they have approximately 20 live users.

								External testing and refinements during the Beta period are necessary to ensure your app's success. We ask for 20 users before considering an app out of Beta because your primary goal with Zapier should be retention: Your first users and testers should be drawn from your internal user base—we recommend surveys and blog posts with embedded Zaps to capture interest while still in Beta, as well as reaching out to all those who have expressed interest in integrations.

											Pitching the tech press, industry publications, and local business news reporters helps spread the word as well and will often get picked up by news sites and automated SaaS news aggregators. Some good examples of past press releases around new integrations:
										Element:a
											Google Slides
											,
										Element:a
											RingCentral
											,
										Element:a
											ShipStation
											,
										Element:a
											WordSmith

											It helps to have a PR firm to help increase the reach of your releases, but a good general tip if you don't have one is to build a very targeted list of journalists and publications that cover the topic, and reach out to them with your article. Persistence pays off here, since it's likely only some will be able to cover it. It also helps to maintain those ongoing relationships, and tailor the language in your outreach to their interests.
									Node:

											Note: While we would like to team up with each new partner on this activity, the volume of partners prevents us from doing so as our press contacts have even frankly asked us, "Don't you launch a new integration every day?" This activity is most impactful when it comes from your side.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Another angle you might try is targeted paid promotion of your integration. Facebook, for example, offers the option to "Boost" content—like a link to your blog post about the integration—to a targeted audience. There are Facebook audiences of people interested in pages related to, for example, marketing automation, that may be receptive to your news, too.

											Your app is now more powerful than ever, thanks to integration possibilities with other partners. Reach out to them for shared promotion - For example,

											Thinkific
											paired with other partners to offer discounts and
										Element:a
											TimeCamp
											reached out to other apps to get exposure via blog posts.

											Whenever a Zap is applicable to something we’re writing about on the blog, we might embed a template. Having more useful Zap templates helps you cover a wide range of applications! Popular Zap templates often get featured inside other partner apps through our dynamic embedding widget. This means exposure to other partners’ user-bases because their Zap template uses your app.

											Beyond adding a Zapier listing to your integrations directory, our most successful partners add dozens of Zapier-supported apps to their directory, too, expanding their reach.
									Node:

											For example,
										Element:a
											Asana's Evernote integration

											Nimble's AWeber integration
											,
										Element:a
											ScheduleOnce's App Directory
