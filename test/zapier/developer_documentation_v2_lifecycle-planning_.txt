					Exciting times! You're looking to hook your app into Zapier, this is the place to start.

					This guide will get you started in the right direction. It will set expectations and provide an overview of how new apps are added to Zapier.

					Outside of this guide, the most important thing you'll want to read and often refer to is our

					Style Guide
					. The Style Guide has the do's and don'ts of building your app on Zapier. Any app which seeks to be available for all users on Zapier must follow the points listed in the Style Guide.

								There are a lot of reasons why you might want to create an App on Zapier. The two broad categories are:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Adding an app to Zapier for just you or your co-workers to use
							Element:li
								Adding an app to Zapier for anyone to use
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you're in the first category then only the Planning (the rest this section) and
							Element:a
								Development
								stages of the
							Element:a
								App Lifecycle
								apply to you.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you're in the latter category then all stages of the
							Element:a
								App Lifecycle
								will apply to you.

								Motivation

								If you plan to add an app that anyone can use, your primary motivation should be user retention and satisfaction. You should already have users asking for integrations.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Zapier is not a distribution platform. We drive few new users back to individual apps. If your primary motivation for adding an app to Zapier is to gain users, stop now: you'll be disappointed by the results.

								Launching a public app on Zapier also implies a series of commitments:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Commitment to follow our Style Guide and technical review/UX feedback -
							Element:a
								Details here.
							Element:li
								Commitment to a co-marketed launch with us -
							Element:a
								Details here.
							Element:li
								Commitment to support your app on an ongoing basis, which includes providing a responsive contact for any issues surfaced by Zapier support -

								Details here.

								Before you begin development, you'll want to plan out what triggers and actions to build. If you haven't yet, please read
							Element:a
								How Zapier Works
								and set up a few Zaps to get a sense of the user experience.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Building on the Zapier platform is different from other app platforms in the sense that you'll be creating discrete triggers and actions instead of defining an entire app's end-to-end user experience.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								However, it is similar in the sense that end user experience still matters
							Element:strong
								a lot
								. Simply pointing triggers and actions at your public API endpoints isn't enough. You'll want to strongly consider which triggers and actions your app will support to start and what the user experience looks like while setting up a Zap that includes your trigger or action.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The most successful platform apps on Zapier only have a few (2 or 3) triggers and actions to start. You can always add more over time as users request them. If you need help figuring out what might be useful to your users, you can browse the
							Element:a
								Zapbook
								for similar apps and see what triggers and actions are supported.
