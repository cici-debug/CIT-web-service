					This guide only applies to you if you're planning on making your app
				Element:a
					global
					.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Activation is the process of making your app available to all users on Zapier.
				Element:strong
					Global
					apps receive:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ol
				Element:li
					Zapbook landing page (ex.
				Element:a
					Evernote
					,
				Element:a
					Asana
					and
				Element:a
					Slack
					)
				Element:li
				Element:a
					Zap templates
					, which can be used as Embedded Zaps in your app (ex.
				Element:a
					Eventbrite
					and
				Element:a
					Beeminder
					)
				Element:li
					Zapier Help Doc (ex.
				Element:a
					Evernote
					,
				Element:a
					Asana
					and
				Element:a

				Element:li
					Co-marketing support if they have been fully tested - see the
				Element:a
					Marketing Launch guide
					for more details.

					It's important to have the right expectations before going through the activation process. Zapier's platform is about
				Element:strong
					existing user retention and satisfactionâ€”not distribution.
					Being listed on Zapier drives very little traffic back to you because of how many apps there are on our platform.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The most successful apps on Zapier have a lot of existing demand for integrations with the 750+ other apps Zapier supports.

											1. Ensure your app follows the Zapier app Style Guide
										Element:a
											#
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:a
											Style Guide
											is written with the user in mind, ensuring a consistent experience across Zapier. We've launched hundreds of apps on Zapier and the Style Guide is a list of best practices we've learned launching those apps.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Later in the activation process, we'll verify the Style Guide is followed.

											2. Get at least 10 users and 1 live Zap on every Trigger and Action
										Element:a
											#
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Clone your app and place it into Invite-Only mode. Doing so provides you a link to share this instance of your Zapier integration with prospective users.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To see progress towards your goal of 10 users and Trigger and Action use, reference the Statistics box in the Zapier account associated with the Invite-Only app.
									Node:
									(type) c

											The intention of this step is to ensure any show-stopping bugs are worked out and verify existing user demand. Towards this end, your users should be outside of your company.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you have a lot of Triggers and Actions (you shouldn't following
										Element:a
											per style guide
											) you may need more than 10 users because all the Triggers and Actions won't have been tested.

									Node:

											Once you have 10 users with live Zaps and have resolved the issues surfaced by our Automatic Style Guide Checker (found at the bottom of your app's dashboard), submit your Invite-Only app for Global activation. Expect to hear from us after a few business days to assist with the following steps.

											4. Wait for our feedback email
										Element:a
											#
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											After you submit for Global activation, we verify your Invite-Only app has at least 10 users and 1 live Zap for each Trigger and Action. We'll send feedback your way from our
										Element:a
											partners@zapier.com
											inbox.
									Node:

											#
									Node:

										Element:p
											With the feedback email in your hands, make the requested changes via our deploy process (clone, make changes, deploy and replace).
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When you're done, reply to our email. If everything looks good, we'll pass your app to our UX team for a second round of feedback, this time focusing less on the technical aspects and more on the user experience of your integration.

											6. Your app goes Global
										Element:a
											#
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Within a day or so after any necessary changes are complete (and re-submitted) we push the app Global. It takes about 24 hours for an app to be fully Global once we throw the switch. We'll reach out to let you know when we do this.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Every global app has a Zapbook landing page (ex.
										Element:a
											Evernote
											,
										Element:a
											Asana
											and
										Element:a
											Slack
											), and a paired Zapbook page with
										Element:em
											every other app
											on Zapier,
										Element:a
											like this
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Global apps are
										Element:strong
											completely functional
											, and anyone can use yours by visiting your Zapbook page, trying your Zap templates, or making a new Zap with it in the editor. The invitation link is no longer required.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The first part of being Global on Zapier is a Beta phase:

										Element:strong
											7. Enter the Beta phase
										Element:a
											#
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											We consider an app to be in Beta until there are approximately 20 live users on it (ideally, most of them from your userbase, not staff). A "Beta" tag will appear above your app logo on Zapier during this time.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											During that time we will keep an eye on usage to check that customers are having a good experience with setting up and running Zaps. We keep a close watch on support feedback during this time, too. At the start of this phase we'll expect you to create help docs and 8 Zap templates using your app: These baseline materials are required for every public app on Zapier.

											#
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:img
									Node:

											Help docs assist users creating their first Zap or give them a quick answer to an error. This combination can greatly ease your team's customer support load related to Zapier at launch.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In order to complete your activation, you will need to submit your help docs to us.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You'll only need to submit info for your app's "How to get started" copy and screenshots via our form, only plain unformatted text is needed and the screenshots we request. The formatting and all the other parts of the documentation are automatically generated by us.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											To submit your documentation to us,
										Element:a
											please fill in this form here.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:em
											Please note that it will take a few moments and you will need to provide some screenshots. It is also really important to select the correct "auth type" when you are filling the form in. If you choose the wrong type you may need to resubmit your docs to us. If you have any questions about this form, please feel free to
										Element:a
											drop us a message
											before submitting the form.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											On top of us hosting your help docs, it greatly benefits your users to publish documentation on your site too, as well. For an example, check out
										Element:a
											WooCommerceâ€™s help docs

											Now comes the fun partâ€”showing our mutual users how they can make use of your app on Zapier. To do so, please submit 8 Zap templates for review, which will then
										Element:a
											populate your Zapbook page
											and be available for you to
										Element:a
											embed in your app
											,
										Element:a
											launch post

											When creating Zap templates, you'll need to:
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											Use each Trigger and Action at least once
										Element:li
											Include a variety of app categories, e.g. show how your app can connect with a CRM, email marketing app and project management tool

											8. Over 20 users: Out of Beta
										Element:a
											#
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											External testing and refinements during the Beta period are natural and necessary for an app's success. We ask for 20 users before considering an app out of Beta because your primary goal with Zapier should be retention. Your first users and testers should be drawn from your internal userbaseâ€”we recommend surveys and blog posts with embedded Zaps to capture interest while still in Beta, as well as reaching out to all those who have expressed interest in integrations.
