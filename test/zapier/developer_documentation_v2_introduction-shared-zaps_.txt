					A Zap template is a pre-defined and curated example of an automated workflow. It allows you to propose recommended use-cases, and provides users with a guided setup experience including pre-filled options and fields so they don't have to create them from scratch in the
				Element:a
					Zap Editor
					.
			Node:
			(type) c

				Element:p
					One of the best parts about Zap templates is that they can be
				Element:a
					embedded in your app
					, keeping users on your site as the sign-up and setup experience happens in a pop-up.

					The 3 goals of Zap templates are:

				Element:ul
				Element:li
					Provide a compelling use-case with a helpful description
				Element:li
					Save users time by pre-mapping fields
				Element:li
					Ensure that users don't run into errors by hiding unnecessary fields and required field mappings.

					There are two main parts to a Zap Template:

				Element:ul
				Element:li
					The written
				Element:em
					title and description
					, where the use-case is explained, describing how it solves a particular problem, the way it works, and the change it produces in your workflow.
				Element:li
					The configured
				Element:em
					Trigger and Action steps
					, where you'll pre-select specific options, map the appropriate fields, and offer specific help text if needed. Like user-created Zaps, the most basic Zap templates have only a Trigger and Action step, but they can have
				Element:a
					as many steps as you like
					.
