					A test trigger is a regular
				Element:a
					trigger
					with a special responsibility. The test trigger is the trigger Zapier will use to verify the authentication credentials users provide when they first attempt to access your API through Zapier. If your API returns a
				Element:code
					2XX
					status code, we will assume the credentials are valid. Anything else (or an empty response that isn't a
				Element:code
					204
					), and we will assume the credentials are bad.
			Node:

				Element:p
					You can only mark one trigger as the test trigger. A test trigger can be made for any endpoint in your API that:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ol
				Element:li
					Requires authentication
				Element:li
					Is guaranteed to always return some data (or a 204 for empty responses)
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Some examples of good endpoints to use for the test trigger:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
					A url like
				Element:code
					/ping
					that is meant solely to test authentication
				Element:li
					An endpoint that returns a user's profile
				Element:li
					An endpoint for high-level objects in your API that users are virtually guaranteed to have (i.e. contacts if you are a CRM, tickets if you are a support center)

								In your app, you'll need choose a trigger that performs a "simple test" when its Polling URL is used to access an endpoint that requires valid authorization/credentials.

								If your trigger is intended to be solely used for authentication testing, then you can mark it hidden.

								When your test trigger fails, a message will be displayed to the user "App returned (400) Error and said nothing" or something similar. This is constructed from the response status code and status message returned from your endpoint, along with a message from the response body, like so:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:blockquote
							Element:p
								App return (
							Element:code
								response.status_code
								)
							Element:code
								response.status_message
								and said
							Element:code
								response.body
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The message is interpreted from the response.body as such:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
								We check to see if you send back JSON. If so, we look for a message field, or similar in the JSON object.
							Element:li
								We check to see if you send back an XML file (i.e., xml in the Content-Type header). If so, we do a similar lookup for an error message in the body.
							Element:li
								We then check to see if you sent back a plain text response(i.e., Content-Type: text/plain). If so, we check that the content is < than 180 characters and use it verbatim.
