					Anyone can add an app to Zapier, usually without writing any new code. This quick guide will familiarize you with the Zapier Developer Platform and get you pointed in the right direction building your own app. When you're finished, you’ll be able to use the app in your own Zapier account, share it privately with others, or even
				Element:a
					submit your app to be available globally
					to anyone with a Zapier account. Plus, you'll have integrations with the 750+ apps on our platform instantly.

								Building a Zapier app requires connecting an API to our Developer Platform. Essentially, the platform shows us how to translate the way you access and update data within your app into Zapier terms. Most Zapier apps include include
							Element:em
								Triggers
								(reading new data from an app) and
							Element:em
								Actions
								(writing data to an app), using
							Element:em
								authentication
								from the end user so the data is specific to their account.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Depending on your app, you may have only triggers or actions. Zapier's end-users build workflows with these Triggers and Actions. A Trigger is the event we watch for that kicks off a workflow, and an Action is the task we complete on their behalf.

								A Zapier app with authentication, a Trigger, and an Action is a great start! If you’re ready to enhance your Zapier app, consider adding a couple more Triggers or Actions. Our
							Element:a
								style guide
								recommends starting with no more than three of each, so choose the most common ways people use your app.
						Node:

								Want to make your Zapier app available globally to any user? Now would be a good time to

								review the app lifecycle
								to get an idea for what’s needed to make you most successful. Once your app is public, we’ll work with you to

				Element:a
					#
			Node:

				Element:p
					Zapier is a tool for primarily
				Element:strong
					non-technical
					users to connect together web apps.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					An integration between two apps is called a Zap. A Zap is made up of a Trigger and one or more Actions or Searches.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Whenever the trigger happens in one app, Zapier will automatically perform the actions or searches in another app in order.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
				Element:img
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Zaps are very lightweight and easy to set up. Zaps do not import or export old data (they only operate on new items created after the Zap is enabled). Zaps are also not kept in sync ("two way syncing") after the Zap is triggered.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Zaps are deceivingly simple if you're used to dealing with complex and difficult integrations. Their simplicity is what enables anyone to create them.

					What is the Developer Platform?
				Element:a
					#
			Node:

			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The Zapier Developer Platform is a way for anyone to add their app or API to Zapier. There are two main reasons for building an app:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ol
				Element:li
					So that you can hook your own internal API up to other apps for yourself or co-workers
				Element:br
				Element:li
					So that you can let anyone on Zapier hook your app up to others
				Element:br
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Building an app is easy and should take a developer (or someone very familiar with APIs) about a week to build a completed app ready for the
				Element:a
					activation process
					. There are two interfaces to the Developer Platform. We cover the
				Element:a
					differences between the CLI and Web Builder here

					Why build on Zapier?
				Element:a
					#
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The main reason you should build your app into Zapier is customer retention. Zapier enables you to say "yes!" when customers ask for integrations with other apps.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					If you've built integrations before, you know the ongoing pain of supporting them. Zapier insulates you from ongoing API maintenance, migration, monitoring, failover and customer support for other APIs.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Building an app on Zapier is
				Element:em
					easier
					than integrating with other APIs and you only have to do it once. You'll automatically get integrations with everyone on Zapier today and into future.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Building your app on Zapier is free for vendors. Zapier is a Software-as-a-Service product and Zapier charges end-users to connect apps together.

					Once your app is Global on Zapier, there are a lot of opportunities for co-marketing
