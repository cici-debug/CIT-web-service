				Element:p
					If you've used
				Element:a
					Django
					or
				Element:a
					Mustache
					(or many other templating engines), you are probably well versed in the variable syntax we use. This also happens to be the exact same syntax our users use to map data from triggers into
				Element:a
					Action Fields
					(though they get a dropdown interface to do it).
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Given the following context (think
				Element:a
					authentication fields
					or data from triggers):
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:span
					{
				Element:span
					"id"
				Element:span
					:
				Element:span
					123456
				Element:span
					,
				Element:span
					"owner"
				Element:span
					:
				Element:span
					"Larry"
				Element:span
					,
				Element:span
					"title"
				Element:span
					:
				Element:span
					"Hello world!"
				Element:span
					,
				Element:span
					"description"
				Element:span
					:
				Element:span
					"It's a beautiful day!"
				Element:span
					}
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					And the following template (think
				Element:a
					authentication mapping
					or
				Element:a
					action fields
					):
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:span
					{
				Element:span
					"talking_user"
				Element:span
					:
				Element:span
					"{{owner}}"
				Element:span
					,
				Element:span
					"chat_message"
				Element:span
					:
				Element:span
					"{{title}} and of course {{description}}"
				Element:span
					}
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					We will generate the following output:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:span
					{
				Element:span
					"talking_user"
				Element:span
					:
				Element:span
					"Larry"
				Element:span
					,
				Element:span
					"chat_message"
				Element:span
					:
				Element:span
					"Hello world! and of course It's a beautiful day!"
				Element:span
					}
