					Below is our simple standard to stop the
				Element:a
					Polling Madness
					™. This is a suggested pattern for you to implement. It was chosen because there are many examples of REST APIs providing resources around GETing, POSTing and DELETEing webhooks just like any other REST resource.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The big benefit to REST Hooks is consumers wouldn't need to poll for changes, but could instead wait for hooks to deliver the payload. Additionally, producers can provide real-time updates with fewer devoted resources (compared to polling).
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The gist is: we POST a subscription
				Element:code
					/api/hooks
					requesting to receive hooks at some target URL. Every time the event happens, ping us at the target URL with the payload.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					After we're done, we can cleanup with a DELETE (
				Element:code
					/api/hooks/:id
					).
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
				Element:em
					Though we highly recommend this native pattern, you can override all the methods below with
				Element:a
					scripting
					. This means you can bend our pattern to match an existing pattern of your own.

									Node:

											This endpoint reuses whatever auth standard you have across the rest of your API (IE: Basic Auth, API Key, OAuth2, etc...). We'd send along a

										Element:code
											{"id": 1234}

											Generally, subscription URLs should be unique. Return a

											This hook could provide any amount of data or payload in either JSON or XML (or form-encoded). Just like static webhooks, we'll do our best to parse the response.
									Node:

										Element:p
											Usually Zapier expects an array of objects. If your API only sends a single object, wrap it in a single element array:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:span
											[
										Element:span
											{
										Element:span
											"firstName"
										Element:span

										Element:span
											,
										Element:span
											"lastName"

											:
										Element:span
											"Smith"
										Element:span
											}
										Element:span
											]
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											On a successful hook, we'll return a
										Element:code
											200
											status code, content is irrelevant.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:blockquote
										Element:p
											If Zapier responds with a
										Element:code
											410
											status code you should immediately remove the subscription to the failing hook (unsubscribe). Additionally, excessive failures (multiple
										Element:code
											4xx
											or
										Element:code
											5xx
											failures) can be handled at your discretion. It is the clients responsibility to resubscribe if needed after failures.

									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you've properly stored identification data about the hook (like its unique ID) from the
										Element:code
											post_subscribe
											scripting method, you should use our
										Element:code
											pre_unsubscribe
											scripting method to formulate the DELETE call. In that call you have access to your previously stored data under the
										Element:code
											bundle.subscribe_data
											variable.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:a
											Some example code is provided to make this as easy as possible.
											A heads up: you will need to use that code if you intend to do a DELETE call. You'll be able to access
										Element:code
											bundle.subscribe_data
											to build the URL in
										Element:code
											pre_unsubscribe
											. The default behavior is slightly different and listed below.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The value for the
										Element:strong
											unsubscribe_endpoint
											field can be specified within the "Manage Trigger Settings" option in your app's dashboard.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											However, the
										Element:strong
											current default
											does not perform a DELETE. For example, if you omit the
										Element:code
											pre_unsubscribe
											function entirely, we will attempt a default unsubscribe call:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											POST <unsubscribe_endpoint>
										Element:span
											\
											-H Content-Type: application/json
										Element:span
											\
											-d
										Element:span
											'{"target_url": "https://hooks.zapier.com/<unique_target_url>"}'
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											On a successful unsubscribe, return a
										Element:code
											200
											status code, content is irrelevant.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											It is worth remembering that the subscription URL should effectively be unique (this could be enforced by your app as well) which also allows us to clean up unrecognized hooks (we also recommend not requiring authentication for such an endpoint).

											Required to Go Global: Set a polling URL
										Element:a
											#
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In the trigger setup, there is a field to define a polling URL. This URL will be used when users are setting up a Zap and must test it. Without this defined, the user must always go to your app, create a new data point, and have it send the hook to Zapier. This is not ideal, and in some cases may be particularly undesirable (if for example other Zaps are already set up on that hook, it would trigger them).
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Setting up a polling URL fixes this. The polling URL is only used during this testing phase, not during the regular operation of the Zap. If you need to script special behavior, you can do so using the standard
										Element:code
											pre_poll
											and
										Element:code
											post_poll
											methods on the trigger key.
