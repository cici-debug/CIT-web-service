For more information see this explanation from Yahoo. The Paperboy web site currently uses WOEIDs on all our city listing pages, for example the URL for our London page looks like this: http://www.thepaperboy.com/england/newspapers/london/city.cfm?woeid=44418 As you can see, the WOEID for London is 44418. If you want to find a WOEID for a particular place you can either look up the corresponding Paperboy page or use this handy WOEID lookup tool "
