					RESTful Transaction API

					If you want flexibility and full control over the entire payment process, consider our RESTful Transaction API. This is a great option if most of your transactions are card present and you are looking to reduce your PCI scope by using encrypted card readers.

					Hosted Payment Page (HPP)

				Element:a
					Our Hosted Payment Page is an ideal option if you’re looking to process secure payments on your eCommerce website and most of your transactions are card not present. While your site handles the shopping experience, Clearent will handle gathering payment information with a Clearent Hosted Payment Page, removing your system from ever seeing or handling sensitive cardholder data.
