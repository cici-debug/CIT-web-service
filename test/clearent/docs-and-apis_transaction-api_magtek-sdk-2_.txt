					With the all too common occurrence of data breaches these days, it’s important that you protect your business and your customers with an encrypted card reader. At Clearent, we support all Magtek Magnesa encrypted devices shown below to encrypt the information on your customers’ credit and debit cards, helping you to provide a safe and secure payment experience.

					In the marketplace, there are two types of card readers: those with what is known as keyboard emulation and those without. They are also known as KB and non-KB devices. With keyboard emulation, host applications are able to get the data directly from the USB swipe card reader and don’t require specially written drivers. Non-KB emulation devices do require drivers, and the Software Development Kits (SDKs) for those are listed below.
