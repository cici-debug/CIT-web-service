					The API Key is a system-generated value that is unique to a particular transaction originator, and is the primary item that must be configured before you can begin using the API.

					When requesting an API Key, you can turn on or off the originatorâ€™s ability to perform the following types of transaction requests:
				Element:ul
				Element:li
					Sale
				Element:li
					Forced Sale
				Element:li
					Authorization
				Element:li
					Capture
				Element:li
					Refund
				Element:li
					Void

					In many cases, the originator is managing user-level permissions by its own mechanism, so there is no need to limit the permissions associated with an API Key; but the capability exists to manage these at the Clearent Gateway if you so choose.
