											Clearent uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error resulted from the provided information (a required parameter is missing or a charge failed), codes in 5xx range indicate an error with Clearent’s servers.
										Element:p
											NOTE: Not all errors map cleaning onto HTTP response codes. When a request is valid but does not complete successfully (card declined) we return a 402.
