											Transaction Flow
										Element:p
											All transaction requests use Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) with Transport-Layer Security (TLS). When the Gateway receives a request, it authenticates the originator by inspecting the API Key that is included in either the header or the body of the request.
										Element:p
											The following diagram depicts the information flows that are made possible by the RESTful API:

											The numbered points in the diagram highlight how the Clearent Gateway:
										Element:ol
										Element:li
											Receives a payment transaction request;
										Element:li
											Authenticates the requestor by validating the API Key, performs validation of the transaction data, then forwards it to the Switch;
										Element:li
											Forwards the transaction request to the front-end processor (not shown), which in turn submits it to the appropriate card associations and issuer for authorization.
										Element:li
											Returns a response message back to the requestor with the result of the transaction request.

											An API Key Identifies an Originator
										Element:p
											Since transactions for a single merchant account may originate from multiple sources, the Gateway permits creation of separate API Keys for different originators, each with different permissions as appropriate. This allows you to distinguish transaction activity according to the originator, whether in reports, or in data feeds.
