					Great minds think alike. If none of these answer your question(s), check out our FAQ Forum at http://support.embed.ly ##What is Embedly? Embedly is a set of front-end tools that help web and app developers create better user experiences. We believe the best tools are simple, easy to use, and perfectly suited to their task. You’ll find that embodied in Embed, Extract, Display, and Video—tools that provide ultra-fast ways to present richer content more effectively. For more information, see our Products [API](http://embed.ly/api) [Cards](http://embed.ly/cards) ##Why Embedly? Because it's the easiest way to present rich content and create user experiences. In less then 10 minutes, you can embed content from hundreds of providers and generate rich previews for any URL on the web. Here's a quote from James Patterson, the Platform Lead at Yammer: If we weren't using Embedly we'd have had to spend probably around a week of an engineer's time to build something that gets the basic job done. It wouldn't be nearly as good, we'd have to deal with constant bug fixes and we'd be paying Amazon $200-$300 a month to host it anyway. Using Embedly is a no-brainer. See our [Customers](http://embed.ly/customers) page for more testimonials. We take care of every step of the process: retrieving information about a URL, checking it against malware registries, extracting content, making additional API calls to providers that support them, parsing RSS feeds, and performing validation. We save you time so that you can focus on making your app great. ##Am I paying for content? No, you're paying for the use of Embedly's processing engine. You're responsible for any copyright implications that may come from embedding third-party content in your site or app. ##How fast is Embedly? Fast. Embedly uses several techniques to accelerate the embedding process: * **Caching**: The first time we see a URL, we store its contents in our cache so that repeated requests can be processed immediately. We invalidate the cache at least once every 12-24 hours. * **Parallel processing**: Once we've resolved the initial URL, we perform the API calls, image parsing, and malware detection in parallel. * **Batch processing**: Send up to 10 URLs at a time to Embedly, and we'll process them all in parallel. ##Where can I find a demo of Embedly in action? You should check out what our [Customers](http://embed.ly/customers) have been building.
