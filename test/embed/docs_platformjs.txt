					``plaform.js`` is Embedly's JavaScript library for creating cards, buttons, modals and interacting with the player apis. [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "Install" } [/block] There are multiple ways to install ``platform.js`` into your page, here is the preferred method. Copy and paste the following code to the ``<body>`` of your document. [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "<script>\n (function(w, d){\n var id='embedly-platform', n = 'script';\n if (!d.getElementById(id)){\n w.embedly = w.embedly || function() {(w.embedly.q = w.embedly.q || []).push(arguments);};\n var e = d.createElement(n); e.id = id; e.async=1;\n e.src = ('https:' === document.location.protocol ? 'https' : 'http') + '://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js';\n var s = d.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];\n s.parentNode.insertBefore(e, s);\n }\n })(window, document);\n</script>", "language": "html" } ] } [/block] This allows embedly to install ``platform.js`` javascript in an async manner, but still queue requests immediately. If you will not be integrating the the ``embedly`` global object then you can also use: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "<script async src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js\" charset=\"UTF-8\"></script>", "language": "html" } ] } [/block]
