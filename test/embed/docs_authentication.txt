					[block:callout] { "type": "success", "title": "Need an API Key?", "body": "No problem! Sign up for one at [app.embed.ly](https://app.embed.ly/signup)" } [/block] To authenticate your requests, include ``key`` as a query parameter, it should look like this:: ``https://api.embedly.com/:version/:endpoint?key=:key&<additional query parameters>`` Choose ``:version`` and ``:endpoint`` depending on the part of the API that you want to access, e.g. ``1/oembed`` for the [/1/oembed](doc:oembed) or ``1/extract`` for the [/1/extract](doc:extract). Replace ``:key`` with the unique API key shown in [the app dashboard](https://app.embed.ly).. [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "Restricting Access" } [/block] By default, Embedly allows requests from anywhere. Tighter security is also an option. You can use the **API > Key** section of [the app dashboard](https://app.embed.ly) to create a whitelist of referrers and/or IP addresses that Embedly will accept requests from. All other requests will be rejected with a ``403 Forbidden`` response. We use a simple "globbing" syntax for referrers, where ``*`` is a wildcard that will match any number of characters. To allow all traffic from ``yourdomain.com`` (but not its subdomains), you would enter ``yourdomain.com*``. To allow subdomains as well, you would make it ``*yourdomain.com*``. Take note of the wildcard at the end, which means that requests that indicate a path as well as a host (e.g. ``yourdomain.com/foo``) will be accepted. Globbing works similarly for IP addresses. If all of your requests come from a cluster of servers with IP addresses in the range ``1.1.1.1`` to ``1.1.1.255``, then you would set a single rule ``1.1.1.*``. [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "OAuth" } [/block] Two-legged OAuth is supported as an alternative to key-based authentication. Your account can only be configured to use either key-based authentication or OAuth, not both. To switch from one form of authentication to the other, visit the **API > Key** section of [the app dashboard](https://app.embed.ly).
