														boolean
												Node:

														Set to true if growing the image is allowed. Otherwise the image will never expand beyond it’s original dimensions, making width and height behave like max width and max height.

														Setting animate to false will convert the image to the first frame of animation for animated images. Setting this value on non-animated images will have non effect and is safe to do.

											Documentation
											Crop an image to fill the given dimensions. The image will first be resized to it’s smallest possible size that will fill the entire given dimensions, preserving it’s aspect ratio. The image is then centered within the given dimensions, and any part of the image that doesn’t fit is removed. The same amount is trimmed from each side of the image in the cropping dimension.
