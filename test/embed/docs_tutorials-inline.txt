					Displaying images and videos inline is the most popular use case for Embedly. With Embedly jQuery, you can add rich media to any site with just a few lines of code. [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "Example 1: Replace" } [/block] It's tricky to show an inline example because it fit seamlessly into a normal web page. For the first example we will show an inline image. [block:embed] { "html": "<iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjsfiddle.net%2Fkhhg7dw2%2F%3Fheight%3D700%26tabs%3Dresult%2Cjs%2Chtml%2Ccss%2Cresources&src=https%3A%2F%2Fjsfiddle.net%2Fkhhg7dw2%2Fembedded%2Fresult%2Cjs%2Chtml%2Ccss%2Cresources%2F&type=text%2Fhtml&key=02466f963b9b4bb8845a05b53d3235d7&schema=jsfiddle\" width=\"600\" height=\"700\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>", "url": "https://jsfiddle.net/khhg7dw2/?height=700&tabs=result,js,html,css,resources", "title": "Edit fiddle - JSFiddle", "favicon": "https://jsfiddle.net/favicon.png" } [/block] The above example uses [Embedly jQuery](https://github.com/embedly/embedly-jquery) to just replace all the ``a`` tags with the embedded media. The html looks like: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "<p>\n <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/TwWnNSIXRo/\">http://instagram.com/p/TwWnNSIXRo/</a>\n</p>", "language": "html" } ] } [/block] And with just a little bit of JS we can replace the ``a`` tag with the image. [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "$('p a').embedly({\n key: 'Your Embedly Key',\n query: {maxwidth:530} });", "language": "javascript" } ] } [/block] [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "Example 2: Click to Replace" } [/block] To slow it down a bit and show you what actually happened, here is the same HTML. Click on the button to see the image be replaced inline. [block:embed] { "html": "<iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjsfiddle.net%2Fvafv6pkm%2F1%2F%3Fheight%3D700%26tabs%3Dresult%2Cjs%2Chtml%2Ccss%2Cresources&src=https%3A%2F%2Fjsfiddle.net%2Fvafv6pkm%2F1%2Fembedded%2Fresult%2Cjs%2Chtml%2Ccss%2Cresources%2F&type=text%2Fhtml&key=02466f963b9b4bb8845a05b53d3235d7&schema=jsfiddle\" width=\"600\" height=\"700\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>", "url": "https://jsfiddle.net/vafv6pkm/1/?height=700&tabs=result,js,html,css,resources", "title": "Edit fiddle - JSFiddle", "favicon": "https://jsfiddle.net/favicon.png" } [/block] The JavaScript looks like this [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "$('.button').on('click', function(){\n $('p a').embedly({query: {maxwidth:530} });\n});", "language": "javascript" } ] } [/block]
