					LinkedIn utilizes Embedly's API to embed content on your profile. You do not need to sign up for an Embedly account in order to embed on LinkedIn. A couple things to start: * LinkedIn does not allow embedding articles or websites into your profiles. You can link to an article or website though and this is LinkedIn's [help page on the subject](https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3236/~/adding-a-website-to-your-profile) * You can embed rich content in your profile, but it has to be from one of these [providers](http://embed.ly/providers). This means you can embed a YouTube video, SlideShare presentation or other media provided the site is on that list. Here's a short video on how to embed on LinkedIn [block:embed] { "html": "<iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fv.embedly.com%252FxwBdg5Gk%26key%3D6e07392b37b9405ab604ec7ae4cce3da%26type%3Dtext%252Fhtml%26schema%3Dembio%26image%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fv-cdn.embedly.com%252Fproduction%252FxwBdg5Gk%252Fthumbnails%252Fthumbnail_0.jpg&url=http%3A%2F%2Fv.embedly.com%2FxwBdg5Gk&image=http%3A%2F%2Fv-cdn.embedly.com%2Fproduction%2FxwBdg5Gk%2Fthumbnails%2Fthumbnail_0.jpg&key=02466f963b9b4bb8845a05b53d3235d7&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=embedly\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>", "url": "http://v.embedly.com/xwBdg5Gk", "title": null, "favicon": "http://v.embedly.com/static/images/favicon.ico", "image": "http://v-cdn.embedly.com/production/xwBdg5Gk/thumbnails/thumbnail_0.jpg" } [/block]
