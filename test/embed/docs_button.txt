					The Embed Button allows you to allow users to embed your site's content with a single click. Get more impressions from all over the web. To create a Button for your site visit the [Button Generator](http://embed.ly/button). [block:callout] { "type": "warning", "title": "platform.js is required.", "body": "In order to use the button you first need to install ``platform.js``. Please see the install instructions [platform.js](doc:platfromjs)" } [/block] By default ``platform.js`` will create a button for an ``A`` tag with the class ``embedly-button``. For example, this will create a button: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "<a class=\"embedly-button\" href=\"http://embed.ly/code\">Embed</a>", "language": "html" } ] } [/block] If you would like to specify a URL to embed, you can use the ``data-url`` property like so: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "<a class=\"embedly-button\" data-url=\"http://apple.com\"\n\t\thref=\"http://embed.ly/code\">Embed</a>", "language": "html" } ] } [/block] [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "Customize" } [/block] There are a number of ``data-*`` attributes that you can use to customize the button. They are as follows: [block:parameters] { "data": { "h-0": "Attribute", "h-1": "Value", "h-2": "Description", "0-0": "data-url", "1-0": "data-theme", "2-0": "data-lang", "3-0": "data-target", "0-1": "URL i.e http://embed.ly", "1-1": "\"round\", \"flat\", \"light-round\", \"light-flat\"", "2-1": "\"en\", \"de\", \"tr\", \"es\"", "3-1": "\"window\" (defaults to modal)", "0-2": "Specifies the URL to embed, by default it uses the URL of the page it is placed on", "1-2": "Sets the look of the button. The default it \"round\"", "2-2": "The language of the Embed button, by default we use the browser's locale.", "3-2": "Opens the embed dialog in a new window instead of a modal." }, "cols": 3, "rows": 4 } [/block] [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "JavaScript" } [/block] With ``Platform.js`` allows you to control buttons programatically. For instance to use a different class name for the button you can use the the following code: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": " embedly('button', 'embed-this');", "language": "javascript" } ] } [/block] If you would like to create a button from a single element you can do the following: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "var a = document.getElementById('#myCard');\nembedly('button', a, {\n target: 'window'\n});", "language": "javascript" } ] } [/block] If ``platform.js`` has not loaded yet, it will queue actions till we are ready to act on them. [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "Modal" } [/block] Modal ----- If you would like to manually trigger the Embed Modal you can do this via the following javascript: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "embedly('modal', 'http://embed.ly');", "language": "javascript" } ] } [/block] This will bring up a modal in which the user can choose to copy the Embed code. If you wish to open the dialog in a new window instead, you may use the following code: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "embedly('modal', {\n url: 'http://embed.ly',\n target: 'window'\n});", "language": "javascript" } ] } [/block] For more information on the cards that button and modals generate, check out the [cards](doc:cards).
