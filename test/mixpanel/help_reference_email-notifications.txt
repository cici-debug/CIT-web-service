								Introduction
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Mixpanel allows you to tie data to a specific user, creating a profile. This is where you store things like their email address, where they came from, or their age. When you include an email address, you can start sending targeted emails right from Mixpanel. At this time, Mixpanel users on a free account are limited to 150,000 email notifications per month.

						Node:

							Element:p
								The targeting criteria for email campaigns are based off of the properties of your user profiles. For example, if you send a
							Element:code
								Signup date
								property, you can create an email that only sends to users who signed up over two weeks ago.

								Sending email addresses to Mixpanel
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can only send emails to users whose profiles have the special
							Element:code
								$email
								property. The value of this property should be the email address of the user as a string - something like
							Element:code
								"joe.doe@example.com"
								. To set this property with the JavaScript library, you can make a call to
							Element:a
								mixpanel.people.set
								:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:span
								mixpanel
							Element:span
								.
							Element:span
								people

								Creating an email notification
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								An email notification consists of a from-name and address, a subject, and a message body. To create a new email notification, navigate to the Notifications report and select "Email Message" from the "Create new notification" dropdown. This will give you the following form:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This interface should be largely self-explanatory, but it's important to note that you can use profile properties in all of the email fields.

								Using profile properties in emails
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Our templates will replace content that is wrapped in
							Element:code
								{{}}
								. For example, if you add a
							Element:code
								Location
								property to your user profiles, you can send messages like this:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								Come and visit us at our
							Element:span
								{{
							Element:span
								${Location}
							Element:span
								}}
								office!
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A user with a profile property
								Come and visit us at our Asheville office!
							Element:em
								Location: Asheville
								will get the following message:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If some of your profiles have a value but others don't, you can use a fallback value:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								Come and visit us at our
							Element:span
								{{
							Element:span
								${Location}
							Element:span
								|
							Element:span
								fallback
							Element:span
								:
							Element:span
								"nearest"
							Element:span
								}}
								office!
						Node:

								Profiles without a
								Come and visit us at our nearest office!
							Element:code

								property will receive this message:

								Using conditional logic in emails
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When a fallback value for a missing people property is not enough, you can also use conditional blocks to change the contents of your message. We treat the tags
							Element:code
								{%
								and
							Element:code
								%}
								as conditional logic, meaning you can use these tags to create a conditional email message.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								There are three tags which will always appear in a conditional block in the same order:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								The if tag (explained below)
							Element:li
								The else tag (which is always written
							Element:code
								{% else %}
								)
							Element:li
								The endif tag (which is always written
							Element:code
								{% endif %}
								)
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								{% if ... %}
								tag is the most important as this determines the conditional logic. It consists of:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								An opening
							Element:code
								{%
								and the word if
							Element:li
								A property name, surrounded by
							Element:code
								${
								and
							Element:code
								}
								(just like in a variable)
							Element:li
								A closing
							Element:code
								%}
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If the property name after the "if" is defined for a particular profile (meaning it isn't a boolean false value, an empty string, or a zero), then the text between the if block and
							Element:code
								{% else %}
								will appear in the email sent to that profile. Otherwise, the part between the
							Element:code
								{% else %}
								and the
							Element:code
								{% endif %}
								is included. In our
							Element:code
								Location
								case, we might use a conditional block like this:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:span
								{%
							Element:span
								if
							Element:span
								${Location}
							Element:span
								%}
								Come and visit us at our
							Element:span
								{{
							Element:span
								${Location}
							Element:span
								}}
								office.
							Element:span
								{%
							Element:span
								else
							Element:span
								%}
								You haven't told us your location. Please update your location in your account, and we'll send you to our nearest office.
							Element:span
								{%
							Element:span
								endif
							Element:span
								%}
						Node:

								A user with a profile property
								Come and visit us at our Asheville office.

								will get the following message:

							Element:p
								On the other hand, profiles without a
								You haven't told us your location. Please update your location in your account, and we'll send you to our nearest office.

								Targeting users
						Node:

							Element:p
								When you submit the form, it will ask you to define the targeting criteria for your notification. We're keeping it simple here and restricting the notification to a single user named "Joe Doe". You can use many combinations of profile properties when you're creating a real notification.

								Scheduling your emails
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once you've targeted your users, you just have to schedule the email. There are two options for scheduling emails:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
								Document Sections
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								ASAP notifications:
								These notifications go out to individual users as soon as they match the targeting criteria. It's common for users to go from "not matching" to "matching" - many notifications include a time-based requirement such as "last login was greater than two weeks ago", or one based off of other profile properties that may change.
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Scheduled notifications:
								These notifications can be set to go out at a specified time, day of week, and interval. For example, you could set your notification to go out at 9am PST every Wednesday. When the notification runs, it finds all the users who match the criteria you have defined (and who have never received this notification) and sends it to them.
