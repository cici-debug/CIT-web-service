					Tutorial: Tracking your first event
			Node:

				Element:p
					It should only take a few minutes to get started tracking events.

								Install the Mixpanel JavaScript library
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								First, install a Mixpanel tracking library. In this example, we'll be using the
							Element:a
								JavaScript library
								, but there are many others (such as
							Element:a
								iOS
								and
							Element:a
								Android
								) for sending data from other platforms.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To install the library, just paste the following code into the
							Element:code
								<head>
								section of your HTML page. Make sure to change
							Element:strong
								YOUR_TOKEN
								to your actual project token, which you can find by clicking your name in the upper righthand corner of your Mixpanel project and selecting Settings from the dropdown.

								Track an event
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Each event you want to track is just a single line of code. Or alternatively, if you want to track user actions on your website by creating events in a visual Point & Click Editor without the help of a developer, you can use
							Element:a
								Autotrack
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Here we'll track the "Video played" event; in practice, you should figure out an event that is relevant to your business. We're also including two properties, "length" and "id". Properties describe the event you are tracking or the user who triggered the event. You can include your own properties by passing them in an object as the second argument to
							Element:a
								mixpanel.track
								:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:span
								<script
							Element:span
								type=
							Element:span
								"text/javascript"
							Element:span
								>
							Element:span
								mixpanel
							Element:span
								.
							Element:span
								track
							Element:span
								(
							Element:span
								"Video played"
							Element:span
								,
							Element:span
								{
							Element:span
								"Video length"
							Element:span
								:
							Element:span
								213
							Element:span
								,
							Element:span
								"id"
							Element:span
								:
							Element:span
								"hY7gQr0"
							Element:span
								});
							Element:span
								</script>
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Add your event tracking code to the page and refresh.

								Look at your report
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								At this point, there should be data visible on
							Element:a
								your report
								. The report should look something like this:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:img
								Document Sections
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:a
								Install the library
							Element:li
							Element:a
								Track an event
							Element:li
							Element:a
								Look at your report
