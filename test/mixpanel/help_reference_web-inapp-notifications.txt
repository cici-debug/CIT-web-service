								Mixpanel enables you to create and send rich notifications to users browsing your website. If you are using our
							Element:a
								in-app notifications product
								, there are 3 things you need to make sure of.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
								Include the latest version of the
							Element:a
								Mixpanel JavaScript library
								on your website.
							Element:li
								Make sure you are
							Element:a
								identifying your users
								in your website's JavaScript code.
							Element:li
								Create a web in-app notification on the Notifications tab of the Mixpanel website.

								The Mixpanel JavaScript library will automatically check for a notification when you identify the current user on your site. If a notification is available for the current user that they haven't already seen, it will be displayed immediately in an overlay view.
						Node:

							Element:p
								That's it, you're done!

								Customizing display of an in-app notification
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In JavaScript, Mixpanel web in-app notifications will always render when your webpage is loaded at the point which you call
							Element:a
								identify
								within the JavaScript library. At this time there is no means to control when the in-app is displayed besides calling identify at a specific point on your site.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You do have the ability to customize the look and feel of the Mixpanel web in-app notification. Since the notification is made of up multiple JavaScript elements with CSS styling, the in-app can be modified by adding CSS styling to your site. These will be applied to the Mixpanel web in-app when it is delivered to an end user. As an example of this, you could change the font of the notification.

								Using profile properties
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Just like emails, in-app notifications will replace content wrapped in
							Element:code
								{{}}
								. For example, if you add a
							Element:code
								Location
								property to your user profiles, you can send notifications like this:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								Come and visit us at our
							Element:span
								{{
							Element:span
								${Location}
							Element:span
								}}
								office!
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A user with a profile property
								Come and visit us at our Asheville office! If some of your profiles have a value, but others don't, you can use a fallback value:
							Element:em
								Location: Asheville
								will get the following message:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								Come and visit us at our
							Element:span
								{{
							Element:span
								${Location}
							Element:span
								|
							Element:span
								fallback
							Element:span
								:
							Element:span
								"nearest"
							Element:span
								}}
								office!
						Node:
