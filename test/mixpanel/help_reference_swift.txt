											The easiest way to get Mixpanel into your iOS project is to use
										Element:a
											CocoaPods
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ol
										Element:li
											Install CocoaPods using
										Element:code
											gem install cocoapods
										Element:li
											If this is your first time using CocoaPods, run
										Element:code
											pod setup
											to create a local CocoaPods spec mirror.
										Element:li
											Create a file in your Xcode project called
										Element:code
											Podfile
											and add the following line:
										Element:code
											pod 'Mixpanel-swift'
										Element:li
											Run
										Element:code
											pod install
											in your Xcode project directory. CocoaPods should download and install the Mixpanel library, and create a new Xcode workspace. Open up this workspace in Xcode.
									Node:
									(type) c

								Initializing the library
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To start tracking with the Mixpanel Swift library, you must first initialize it with your project token. Find your project token by clicking your name in the upper righthand corner of your Mixpanel project and selecting Settings from the dropdown.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In most cases, it makes sense to do this in
							Element:a
								application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To initialize the library, first add
							Element:code
								import Mixpanel
								and call
							Element:a
								Mixpanel.initialize(token:)
								with your project token as its argument. Once you've called this method, you can access your instance throughout the rest of your application with
							Element:a
								mainInstance()
								.

								Sending events
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								We recommend tracking only five to seven events in your application instead of tracking too many things to start. Ideally, you track people going through your initial user experience and one key metric that matters for your application (e.g. YouTube might choose "Watched Video" as a key metric).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once you've initialized the library, you can track an event by calling
							Element:a
								track(event:properties:)
								with the event name and properties.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "Plan Selected", properties: ["Plan" : "Premium"])

								Timing events
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can track the time it took for an action to occur, such as an image upload or a comment post, using
							Element:a
								time(event:)
								This will mark the "start" of your action, which you can then finish with a track call. The time duration is then recorded in the "Duration" property.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								Mixpanel.mainInstance().time(event: "Image Upload") //...some time later Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "Image Upload")

						Node:

							Element:h2
								Super properties
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								It's very common to have certain properties that you want to include with each event you send. Generally, these are things you know about the
							Element:strong
								user
								rather than about a specific event—for example, the user's age, gender, or source.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To make things easier, you can register these properties as
							Element:strong
								super properties
								. If you do, we will automatically include them with all tracked events. Super properties are saved to device storage, and will persist across invocations of your app. Mixpanel already stores some information as super properties by default; see a full list of Mixpanel default properties
							Element:a
								here
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To set super properties, call
							Element:a
								registerSuperProperties(_:)
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								// Send a "Plan: Mega" property will be sent // with all future track calls. Mixpanel.mainInstance().registerSuperProperties(["Plan": "Mega"])
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Going forward, whenever you track an event, super properties will be included as properties. For instance, if you call
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "Signup", properties:["Source": "Twitter"])
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								after making the above call to registerSuperProperties, it is just like adding the properties directly:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "Signup", properties:[ "Plan" : "Mega", "Source": "Twitter"])
						Node:

										Element:h3
											Setting super properties once and only once
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you want to store a super property only once (often for things like ad campaign or source), you can use
										Element:a
											registerSuperPropertiesOnce(_:defaultValue:)
											. This function behaves like
										Element:a
											registerSuperProperties(_:)
											and has the same interface, but it doesn't override super properties you've already saved.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											Mixpanel.mainInstance().registerSuperPropertiesOnce(["Source": "ad-01"])
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This means that it's safe to call
										Element:a
											registerSuperPropertiesOnce(_:defaultValue:)
											with the same property on every app load, and it will only set it if the super property doesn't exist.

								Managing user identity
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The Mixpanel library will assign a default unique identifier (we call it a "distinct ID") to each unique user who installs your application. This distinct ID is saved to device storage so that it will persist across sessions.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you choose, you can assign your own user IDs. This is particularly useful if a user is using your app on multiple platforms (both web and mobile, for example). To assign your own distinct_ids, you can use
							Element:a
								identify(distinctId:)
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								// Ensure all future events sent from // the library will have the distinct_id 13793 Mixpanel.mainInstance().identify(distinctId: "13793")
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Calling
							Element:a
								identify(distinctId:)
								with a new ID will
							Element:strong
								change
								the distinctID stored on the device. Updates to user profiles are queued on the device until identify is called.
						Node:

										Element:h3
											Combining anonymous and identifiable user data
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											It's important to send the same distinct_id with each event that an individual user triggers. Events recorded with different distinct_ids will be treated in Mixpanel as if they were performed by different users.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											There are times when it can be convenient to start referring to a user by a different identifier in your implementation. The most common case is after registration, when a user switches from being an anonymous user (with an anonymous distinct_id) to an authenticated user with an (authenticated id). In this case, you can create an
										Element:a
											Alias
											for the user to keep the distinct_id consistent. An alias is a string stored in a Mixpanel lookup table that is associated with an anonymous distinct_id. Once written, aliases are not editable. Any data sent to Mixpanel with an alias as the distinct_id will be remapped and written to disk using the alias's corresponding anonymous distinct_id. This allows you to start identifying a user by an authenticated id without changing the distinct_id that is ultimately written in Mixpanel.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											let mixpanel = Mixpanel.mainInstance() // This makes the current ID (by default an auto-generated GUID) // and '13793' interchangeable distinct ids (but not retroactively). mixpanel.createAlias("13793", distinctId: mixpanel.distinctId); // To create a user profile, you must call identify mixpanel.identify(distinctId: mixpanel.distinctId)
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The recommended usage pattern is to call both
											If you use
										Element:a
											createAlias(_:distinctId)
											and
										Element:a
											identify(distinctId:)
											(with the Mixpanel generated distinctId, as shown in the example above) when the user signs up, and only
										Element:a
											identify(distinctId:)
											(with the aliased user ID) on future log ins. This will keep your signup funnels working correctly.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:a
											createAlias(_:distinctId)
											we recommend only calling it once during the lifetime of the user.

								Storing user profiles
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In addition to events, you can store user profiles in Mixpanel's
							Element:a
								People Analytics
								product. Profiles are persistent sets of properties that describe a user—things like name, email address, and signup date.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can use profiles to explore and segment users by who they are, rather than what they did. You can also use profiles to send notifications, such as emails, SMS, or push notifications.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Before you send profile updates, you
							Element:strong
								must
								call
							Element:a
								identify(distinctId:)
								. This ensures that you only have actual registered users saved in the system.

											// Sets user 13793's "Plan" attribute to "Premium" Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.set(property: "Plan", to: "Premium")
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This will set a "Plan" property, with a value "Premium", on user 13793's profile. If there isn't a profile with distinct_id 13793 in Mixpanel already, a new profile will be created. If user 13793 already has a property named "Plan" in their profile, the old value will be overwritten with "Premium".

											Planning to run an experiment on the initial view of your app? It can take several seconds for experiments to be applied on first app open; as a result, we recommend against putting UX changes or developer Tweaks on the first view of your app. If you wish to A/B test on the initial app view you will need to take delivery latency into account. We recommend enabling the option

								A/B developer tweaks
								For more complex changes that you want to A/B test, you can include small bits of code in your apps called Tweaks. Tweaks allow you to control variables in your app from your Mixpanel dashboard. For example, you can alter the difficulty of a game, choose different paths through the app, or change text. The possibilities are endless.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To use Tweaks in Swift you will initially need to define your Tweaks by extending the class MixpanelTweaks and then setting the Tweaks in the SDK. As an example here we are extending MixpanelTweaks and defining a few Tweaks of different types:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								And then right after initializing the Mixpanel Library with the project token, we set the Tweaks (it makes sense to do this in
							Element:code
								extension MixpanelTweaks { public static let floatTweak = Tweak(tweakName: "floatTweak", defaultValue: 20.5, min: 0, max: 30.1) public static let intTweak = Tweak(tweakName: "intTweak", defaultValue: 10, min: 0) public static let boolTweak = Tweak(tweakName: "boolTweak", defaultValue: true) public static let stringTweak = Tweak(tweakName: "stringTweak", defaultValue: "hello") }

										Element:pre
										Element:code
											let numLives = MixpanelTweaks.assign( MixpanelTweaks.numberOfLives)
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3

											and we define it like so:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											Once you add this line, you will see a Tweak called
										Element:code
											extension MixpanelTweaks { public static let numberOfLives = Tweak(tweakName: "number of lives", defaultValue: 5) }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:code
											number of lives
											with a default value of
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:code
											5
											in the Mixpanel A/B test designer. You can then create an A/B test with a different value for
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:code
											number of lives
											. For example, you could set up an experiment where 50% of your users start a game with 5 lives, and 50% start with 10 lives. When the experiment is not running, the value of numLives will simply be the default of 5.

											extension MixpanelTweaks { public static let actionToTake = Tweak(tweakName: "action to take", defaultValue: 1) }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											and we define it like so:
										Element:code
											let label = UILabel() label.text = MixpanelTweaks.assign(MixpanelTweaks.labelText) label.hidden = MixpanelTweaks.assign(MixpanelTweaks.labelHidden))
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											extension MixpanelTweaks { public static let actionToTake = Tweak(tweakName: "text label", defaultValue: "Hello World") public static let actionToTake = Tweak(tweakName: "text hidden", defaultValue: false) }

											Binding Tweaks
											When designing an A/B test in Mixpanel,
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:code
											MixpanelTweaks.assign
											changes will only apply when the code block they are in is executed. For example if you have an
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:code
											MixpanelTweaks.assign
											to assign text to a label on viewDidLoad, and you made changes to the Tweak in the A/B test designer, you would not see the changes apply until the next time viewDidLoad was called. If you would like to see your changes applied immediately when designing a test, you can use
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:code
											MixpanelTweaks.bind
											to accomplish this.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											let label = UILabel() MixpanelTweaks.bind( MixpanelTweaks.labelText, binding: { label.text = $0 })
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											and we define it like so:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											Whenever the Tweak is changed in the A/B test designer, you will immediately see the new value of the Tweak applied to the given object and property, in this case
										Element:code
											extension MixpanelTweaks { public static let labelText = Tweak(tweakName: "text label", defaultValue: "Hello World") }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:code
											label.text
											.

								If you want to use multiple Mixpanel projects in your app, you can initialize multiple times using different tokens and interact with each instance separately
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								You can also give each instance a different name:
							Element:code
								let mixpanel1 = Mixpanel.initialize(token: "MIXPANEL_TOKEN1") let mixpanel2 = Mixpanel.initialize(token: "MIXPANEL_TOKEN2")
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								Then interact with each Mixpanel instance by its name:
							Element:code
								Mixpanel.initialize(token: "MIXPANEL_TOKEN1", launchOptions: nil, flushInterval: 60, instanceName: "Project1") Mixpanel.initialize(token: "MIXPANEL_TOKEN2", launchOptions: nil, flushInterval: 60, instanceName: "Project2")
						Node:

							Element:code
								Mixpanel.getInstance(name: "Project1").track(event: "Tracked Event!")
						Node:
