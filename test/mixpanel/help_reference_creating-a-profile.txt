								Install the Mixpanel JavaScript library
						Node:

							Element:p
								First, install a Mixpanel tracking library. In this example, we'll be using the
							Element:a
								JavaScript library
								, but there are many others (such as
							Element:a
								iOS
								and
							Element:a
								Android
								) for sending data from other platforms.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To install the library, just paste the following code into the
							Element:code
								<head>
								section of your HTML page. Make sure to change
							Element:strong
								YOUR_TOKEN
								to your actual project token, which you can find by clicking your name in the upper righthand corner of your Mixpanel project and selecting Settings from the dropdown.

								Create a profile
						Node:

							Element:p
								Mixpanel allows you to tie data to a specific user, creating a profile. This is where you store things like their email address, where they came from, or their age.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In this example, we're going to create a new profile with the properties "$first_name", "$last_name", "$created", and "$email". "$email" is a special property used for notifications - special properties have a leading "$". You shouldn't make up your own property names beginning with "$".
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								It's important to note that you must call
							Element:a
								mixpanel.identify
								to actually create a new profile. This flushes data from the client to Mixpanel's servers.

						(type) c

							Element:span
								"Joe"

							Element:span

							Element:span

							Element:span
								"Doe"

								,
							Element:span
								"$created"
							Element:span
								:
							Element:span
								"2013-04-01T09:02:00"
							Element:span

							Element:span

							Element:span
								"joe.doe@example.com"
