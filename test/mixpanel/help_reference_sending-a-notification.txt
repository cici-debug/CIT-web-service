					Tutorial: Sending your first notification
			Node:

					It should only take a couple of minutes to send your first notification.

								Install the Mixpanel JavaScript library
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								First, install a Mixpanel tracking library. In this example, we'll be using the
							Element:a
								JavaScript library
								, but there are many others (such as
							Element:a
								iOS
								and
							Element:a
								Android
								) for sending data from other platforms.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To install the library, just paste the following code into the
							Element:code
								<head>
								section of your HTML page. Make sure to change
							Element:strong
								YOUR_TOKEN
								to your actual project token, which you can find by clicking your name in the upper righthand corner of your Mixpanel project and selecting Settings from the dropdown.

								Create a profile
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Mixpanel allows you to tie data to a specific user, creating a profile. This is where you store things like their email address, where they came from, or their age. When you include contact information, you can start sending targeted notifications right from Mixpanel.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In this example, we're going to set up a new email notification, so we need to create a profile with the "$email" property. Other types of notifications (such as
							Element:a
								iOS
								and
							Element:a
								Android
								push notifications) require different properties.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:span
								mixpanel
							Element:span
								.
							Element:span
								identify
							Element:span
								(
							Element:span
								"13487"
							Element:span
								);
							Element:span
								mixpanel
							Element:span
								.
							Element:span
								people
							Element:span
								.
							Element:span
								set
							Element:span
								({
							Element:span
								"User name"
							Element:span
								:
							Element:span
								"JoeDoe1980"
							Element:span
								,
							Element:span
								"$first_name"
							Element:span
								:
							Element:span
								"Joe"
							Element:span
								,
							Element:span
								"$last_name"
							Element:span
								:
							Element:span
								"Doe"
							Element:span
								,
							Element:span
								"$email"
							Element:span
								:
							Element:span
								"joe.doe@example.com"
							Element:span
								});
						Node:
						(type) c

								Add your tracking code to the page and refresh to create the profile.

								Move to the Notifications report and select "Email Message" in the "Create new notification" dropdown. You should see the following interface:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This interface should be largely self-explanatory, but it's important to note that you can use profile properties in all of the email fields.

											Our templates will replace content that is wrapped in

											. Here we're using the "User name" property we set before. In this case, we additionally wrap the property name in
										Element:code
											${}
											to escape spaces.

								Target users
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you submit the form, it will ask you to define the targeting criteria for your notification. We're keeping it simple here and restricting the notification to the user we just created. You can use many combinations of profile properties when you're creating a real notification.

								Schedule your email
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once you've targeted your users, you just have to schedule the email. There are two options for scheduling emails:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
								Document Sections
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								ASAP notifications:
								These notifications go out to individual users as soon as they match the targeting criteria for the first time. It's common for users to go from "not matching" to "matching" â€“ many notifications include a time-based requirement such as "last login was greater than two weeks ago", or one based off of other profile properties that may change (Mixpanel will only send the notification to a user one time).
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Scheduled notifications:
								These notifications can be set to go out at a specified time, day of week, or interval. For example, you could set your notification to go out at 9am PST every Wednesday. When the notification runs, it finds all the users who match the criteria you have defined (and who have never received this notification) and sends it to them.
