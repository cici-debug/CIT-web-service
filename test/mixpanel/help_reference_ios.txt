								Installing the library
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The easiest way to get Mixpanel into your iOS project is to use
							Element:a
								CocoaPods
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
								Install CocoaPods using
							Element:code
								gem install cocoapods
							Element:li
								If this is your first time using CocoaPods, run
							Element:code
								pod setup
								to create a local CocoaPods spec mirror.
							Element:li
								Create a file in your Xcode project called
							Element:code
								Podfile
								and add the following line:
							Element:code
								pod 'Mixpanel'
							Element:li
								Run
							Element:code
								pod install
								in your Xcode project directory. CocoaPods should download and install the Mixpanel library, and create a new Xcode workspace. Open up this workspace in Xcode.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can also get the library by downloading the
							Element:a
								latest version from Github
								and copying it into your project.
						Node:

								Initializing the library
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To start tracking with the Mixpanel iOS library, you must first initialize it with your project token. Find your project token by clicking your name in the upper righthand corner of your Mixpanel project and selecting Settings from the dropdown.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In most cases, it makes sense to do this in
							Element:a
								application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To initialize the library, first add
							Element:code
								#import "Mixpanel/Mixpanel.h"
								and call
							Element:a
								sharedInstanceWithToken:
								with your project token as its argument. Once you've called this method once, you can access your instance throughout the rest of your application with
							Element:a
								sharedInstance
								.
						Node:

								Sending events
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								We recommend tracking only five to seven events in your application instead of tracking too many things to start. Ideally, you track people going through your initial user experience and one key metric that matters for your application (e.g. YouTube might choose "Watched Video" as a key metric).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once you've initialized the library, you can track an event by calling
							Element:a
								track:properties:
								with the event name and properties.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								Mixpanel *mixpanel = [Mixpanel sharedInstance]; [mixpanel track:@"Plan selected" properties:@{ @"Plan": @"Premium" }];

								Timing events
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can track the time it took for an action to occur, such as an image upload or a comment post, using
							Element:a
								timeEvent:
								This will mark the "start" of your action, which you can then finish with a track call. The time duration is then recorded in the "Duration" property.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								Mixpanel *mixpanel = [Mixpanel sharedInstance]; [mixpanel timeEvent:@"Image Upload"]; [self uploadImageWithSuccessHandler:^{ [mixpanel track:@"Image Upload"]; }];

								Super properties
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								It's very common to have certain properties that you want to include with each event you send. Generally, these are things you know about the
							Element:strong
								user
								rather than about a specific event—for example, the user's age, gender, or source.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To make things easier, you can register these properties as
							Element:strong
								super properties
								. If you do, we will automatically include them with all tracked events. Super properties are saved to device storage, and will persist across invocations of your app. Mixpanel already stores some information as super properties by default; see a full list of Mixpanel default properties
							Element:a
								here
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To set super properties, call
							Element:a
								registerSuperProperties:
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								// Send a "Plan: Mega" property will be sent // with all future track calls. [mixpanel registerSuperProperties:@{@"Plan": @"Mega"}];
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Going forward, whenever you track an event, super properties will be included as properties. For instance, if you call
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								[mixpanel track:@"Signup" properties:@{ @"Source": @"Twitter" }];
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								after making the above call to registerSuperProperties:, it is just like adding the properties directly:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								[mixpanel track:@"Signup" properties:@{ @"Source": @"Twitter", @"Plan": @"Mega" }];

											Setting super properties once and only once
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you want to store a super property only once (often for things like ad campaign or source), you can use
										Element:a
											registerSuperPropertiesOnce:
											. This function behaves like
										Element:a
											registerSuperProperties:
											and has the same interface, but it doesn't override super properties you've already saved.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											[mixpanel registerSuperPropertiesOnce:@{@"Source": @"ad-01"}];
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This means that it's safe to call
										Element:a
											registerSuperPropertiesOnce:
											with the same property on every app load, and it will only set it if the super property doesn't exist.

								Managing user identity
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The Mixpanel library will assign a default unique identifier (we call it a "distinct ID") to each unique user who installs your application. This distinct ID is saved to device storage so that it will persist across sessions.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you choose, you can assign your own user IDs. This is particularly useful if a user is using your app on multiple devices or platforms (both web and mobile, for example). To assign your own distinct_ids, you can use
							Element:a
								identify:
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								// Ensure all future events sent from // the device will have the distinct_id 13793 [mixpanel identify:@"13793"];
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Calling
							Element:a
								identify:
								with a new ID will
							Element:strong
								change
								the distinctID stored on the device. Updates to user profiles are queued on the device until identify is called.

											Combining anonymous and identifiable user data
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											It's important to send the same distinct_id with each event that an individual user triggers. Events recorded with different distinct_ids will be treated in Mixpanel as if they were performed by different users.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											There are times when it can be convenient to start referring to a user by a different identifier in your implementation. The most common case is after registration, when a user switches from being an anonymous user (with an anonymous distinct_id) to an authenticated user with an (authenticated id). In this case, you can create an
										Element:a
											Alias
											for the user to keep the distinct_id consistent. An alias is a string stored in a Mixpanel lookup table that is associated with an anonymous distinct_id. Once written, aliases are not editable. Any data sent to Mixpanel with an alias as the distinct_id will be remapped and written to disk using the alias's corresponding anonymous distinct_id. This allows you to start identifying a user by an authenticated id without changing the distinct_id that is ultimately written in Mixpanel.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											// This makes the current ID (by default an auto-generated GUID) // and '13793' interchangeable distinct ids (but not retroactively). [mixpanel createAlias:@"13793" forDistinctID:mixpanel.distinctId]; // To create a user profile, you must call identify [mixpanel identify:mixpanel.distinctId];
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The recommended usage pattern is to call both
											If you use
										Element:a
											createAlias:
											and
										Element:a
											identify:
											(with the Mixpanel generated distinctId, as shown in the example above) when the user signs up, and only
										Element:a
											identify:
											(with the aliased user ID) on future log ins. This will keep your signup funnels working correctly.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:a
											createAlias:
											we recommend only calling it once during the lifetime of the user.

								Storing user profiles
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In addition to events, you can store user profiles in Mixpanel's
							Element:a
								People Analytics
								product. Profiles are persistent sets of properties that describe a user—things like name, email address, and signup date.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can use profiles to explore and segment users by who they are, rather than what they did. You can also use profiles to send notifications, such as emails, SMS, or push notifications.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Before you send profile updates, you
							Element:strong
								must
								call
							Element:a
								identify:
								. This ensures that you only have actual registered users saved in the system.

											// Sets user 13793's "Plan" attribute to "Premium" [mixpanel.people set:@{@"Plan": @"Premium"}];
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This will set a "Plan" property, with a value "Premium", on user 13793's profile. If there isn't a profile with distinct_id 13793 in Mixpanel already, a new profile will be created. If user 13793 already has a property named "Plan" in their profile, the old value will be overwritten with "Premium".

											Controlling when to show a survey
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You may not want the surveys to show immediately when your app loads. If, for example, you have an app like Skype™, and you want to show a call quality survey at the end of a phone call, you need to turn off the automatic showing of surveys, by setting
										Element:a
											showSurveyOnActive
											to
										Element:code
											NO
											and call
										Element:a
											showSurveyWithID:
											at the appropriate point in your app. When looking at the survey in Mixpanel, the survey ID will be the last number in the URL.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											// In application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: // Turn this off so the survey doesn't pop up automatically. // mixpanel.showSurveyOnActive = NO; - (void)phoneCallEnded { [mixpanel showSurveyWithID:CALL_QUALITY_SURVEY_ID]; }
									Node:

											. For example, you could set up an experiment where 50% of your users start a game with 5 lives, and 50% start with 10 lives. When there are no experiments running, the value of numLives will simply be the default of 5.

											Flow Control Tweaks
											Value Tweaks can also be used to control flow in your app.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											if (MPTweakValue(@"show alternate view", NO)) { // Show alternate view. } else { // Show original view }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											By default, the alternate view will not show. But you can now set up an A/B test that flips this value to
										Element:code
											YES
											for a percentage of your users.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you have more than 2 options, you could use a switch.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											switch (MPTweakValue(@"Action to take", 1)) { case 1: // Do something break; case 2: // Do something else break; case 3: // Do a third thing break; }
									Node:
									(type) c

											You can use Tweaks to assign values to UI elements too.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											UILabel *label = [[UILabel alloc] init]; label.text = MPTweakValue(@"label text", @"Hello World"); label.hidden = MPTweakValue(@"label is hidden", NO);

											Binding Tweaks
											When designing an A/B test in Mixpanel,
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:code
											MPTweakValue
											changes will only apply when the code block they are in is executed. For example if you have an
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:code
											MPTweakValue
											to assign text to a label on viewDidLoad, and you made changes to the Tweak in the A/B test designer, you would not see the changes apply until the next time viewDidLoad was called. If you would like to see your changes applied immediately when designing a test, you can use
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:code
											MPTweakBind
											to accomplish this.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											UILabel *label = [[UILabel alloc] init]; MPTweakBind(label, text, @"label text", @"Hello World");
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The first 2 arguments are an object and a property. Whenever the Tweak is changed in the A/B test designer, you will immediately see the new value of the Tweak applied to the given object and property, in this case
										Element:code
											label.text
											.

								As of version 2.2.0 the Mixpanel iOS library uses ARC.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you are using Mixpanel in a project that does not have ARC enabled, you need to enable ARC for just the Mixpanel source files in your Xcode project settings. This is done by adding the
								INTEGRATION TUTORIALDocument Sections
