								Here at CityGrid, we use the term

								for anyone who uses our content and ad APIs to build web and mobile applications for end users. CityGrid has four tiers of publishers, and this page will help you understand the differences between these tiers, and where you will fit.

								Four Tiers of Publishers
						Node:

							Element:p
								The four tiers are:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Open Publisher
								. A business or individual who uses CityGrid Places, Reviews, and Offers APIs in their web and mobile applications. Anyone can use the
							Element:a
								self-service registration form
								to become an open publisher and use CityGrid places, offers, and review data, provided they follow the
							Element:a
								Usage Requirements
								and the
							Element:a
								Terms and Conditions
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Paid Publisher
								. An approved business or developer who uses CityGrid Places, Reviews, Offers, and Ad APIs, generating revenue through CityGrid ads via
							Element:a
								Places that Pay
								. To become a Paid Publisher, you must submit a fully functional version of your site or application with CityGrid content and advertisements displayed for review by our
							Element:a
								Partner Account Management Team
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Partner Publisher
								. An approved business who uses CityGrid Places, Review, Offers, and Ad APIs in their site. Partner Publishers may be resellers providing data to CityGrid. If you are an existing publisher, have data feeds or APIs you'd like to provide to CityGrid, or have higher volume needs, contact our
							Element:a
								Partner Account Management Team
								. However, it is likely that if you fall into this category, we have already noticed your activity on our network and will be reaching out to you.
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Incubation Publisher
								. This tier of CityGrid Publishers is reserved for publishers who are demonstrating innovative uses of CityGrid APIs, generating high volumes of traffic, and are making a big impact in the space in some way. Examples of publishers who have risen to become Incubation Publishers are
							Element:a
								,
							Element:strong
								UrbanSpoon
							Element:a
								,
							Element:strong
								BuzzLabs
							Element:a
								, and
							Element:strong
								Merchant Circle
							Element:a
								. There is no way to apply to be an Incubation Publisher — you need to already be a publisher who is standing out in some way, and we'll reach out to you.

								Anyone can become a CityGrid Open Publisher: simply
							Element:a
								register
								and start using our Content APIs. If you are looking to monetize and grow your site or application, you will want to enjoy the rewards of becoming a Paid Publisher. CityGrid Paid, Partner, and Incubation Publishers not only enjoy revenue opportunities, they can take advantage of online opportunities such as blog posts, case studies, and other online marketing opportunities, as well as many offline opportunities such as joining us at conferences, hackathons, and contests around the country.
