											Ads by CityGrid
									Node:

										Element:ul

											. Simply by displaying business profiles, you can generate revenue through the
										Element:a
											Places that Pay
										Element:a
											Places that Pay
											program. Anytime a user lands on a
										Element:a
											Places that Pay
											profile, and engages with the content, you make money. This provides you with an additional revenue stream for the profile page. Revenue sharing is as simple as
										Element:a
											tracking
											impressions and referrals.
									Node:

										Element:a
