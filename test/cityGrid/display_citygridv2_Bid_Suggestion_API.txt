											The Bid Suggestion API allows publishers to evaluate the opportunity associated with CityGrid's Optimized Search Result Page (OSRP) in order to make informed decisions in how they buy traffic. Given a search term and location the Bid Suggestion API will provide insight into the number of paid listings and the cumulative budget available, average CPC and average click-through-rate for the listings. Given this information a publisher can compare the eCPM of a search term within a specific location to the cost to buy that traffic.

													Element:p
														Example: A single campaign may have $100 budget remaining for a restaurant listing and an insurance listing. A single search will only show one of these listings and both have $100 available. It's possible that $100 be spent entirely on one of the listings or evenly across both listings.
