					Introduction

					The purpose of this API is to provide our partners with visibility of the traffic we're receiving from them (the number of connections per hour per listing). There are two endpoints of the api. The connections endpoint provides a summary of activity that may be considered billable by hour. The data is meant to be accessed same-day before data has been processed and billable status as been finalized. Therefore, some of the activity may be discounted at the end of the day. A summary of calls received is available for previous days but not intra-day.

											The day is defined from 9 pm PST (previous day) to 9 pm PST (of the date specified). So for a given date, api will return data from 21 hours of the previous day.
