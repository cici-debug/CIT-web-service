							Element:p
								As a
							Element:span
								CityGrid
								partner, you can get paid to display rich, local
							Element:span
								CityGrid
								content and advertising on your site or application. You can request ads by category and geography, and
							Element:span
								CityGrid
								servers will generate advertisements from our comprehensive data stores.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can choose to have
							Element:span
								CityGrid
								generate ad images for you, or simply obtain ad data from
							Element:span
								CityGrid
								and render the images yourself. You can get ad information in XML or JSON, or make an Ajax call to have the images loaded directly in your pages. You can also get paid for various impressions and referrals from certain business listings provided by the
							Element:a
								Places API
								, by adding tracking code to your pages and referral parameters to URLs.

								The

								Custom Ads API
								provides raw ad information in the form of XML so that you can create your own advertisement that matches your applications' look-and-feel. Information returned includes name, address, tag line, rating, reviews, distance from search location, and a destination URL. Your application can navigate to the destination URL when the advertisement is clicked.
