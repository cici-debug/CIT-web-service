								Introduction

							Element:p
								The
							Element:span
								CityGrid
							Element:a
								Places API
								is available to any developer to create mobile applications or websites that display
							Element:span
								CityGrid
								place pages. As a
							Element:span
								CityGrid
								partner, however, you can publish
							Element:span
								CityGrid
								place pages
							Element:em
								and
								get paid when your users engage with the content of certain places. The program that monetizes the display of, and iteraction with,
							Element:span
								CityGrid
								places is called
							Element:strong
								Places that Pay
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To use Places that Pay, make arrangements with our
							Element:a
								Partner Account Management team
								. Then simply use the
							Element:a
								Places API
								and a small amount of tracking code (described below) to display place pages. Everything else is handled by
							Element:span
								CityGrid
								.

								To share advertising revenue, simply notify

								of

								impressions
								and
							Element:strong
								referrals
								. Notification of impressions is done through
							Element:span
								JavaScript
								code (or, when
							Element:span
								JavaScript
								is not available, a tracking pixel) placed on a page, while notification of referrals is done by appending parameters to a URL.

											In order for

											CityGrid
											to know that an element (such as a business
										Element:em
											profile
											, map, or review page) was displayed on your site, include the following
										Element:span
											JavaScript
											fragment on each page where you display our content, replacing the starred content with the relevant page-specific information described in the table that follows.

											The impression tracker should be called only once per page. Each time the tracker is called, it drops cookies which must be stored on the client and returned in the header for subsequent tracker calls.

											When data is accessed using a standard browser, the browser should properly handle the cookies and no additional programming is likely needed. However, for native applications, please consult your platform SDK documentation to verify that cookies are being handled appropriately by your application. Proper cookie handling is required for your elements to be properly tracked.

									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											For URLs that are not encoded, you need to augment them with the given reference ID and your own information. This augmentation must be done on the on click event. In the above example, the reference ID is 2. If your publisher code is "acme" and you would like to use a placement of "home," then you would compose the following URLs for your application to navigate to the map and video URLs respectively:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Encoded URLs do not require publisher, placement or reference_id attached.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											No labels
