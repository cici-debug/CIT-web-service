								Introduction
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:span
								CityGrid
								Offers API enables developers to create applications that access deals and offers in the
							Element:span
								CityGrid
								network. Examples of applications that could use the Offers API include:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Applications that display offers for restaurants in a specified neighborhood
							Element:li
								Applications that display offers for refrigerators in a given metropolitan area
							Element:li
								Applications that display free offers only
						Node:

						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you qualify as a
							Element:span
								CityGrid
								partner, you may use
							Element:a
								Places that Pay
								, which allows you to get paid when using the Offers API. Use
							Element:a
								Impression Tracking
								to notify
							Element:span
								CityGrid
								about impressions and references.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The Offers API consists of two endpoint categories:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:a
								#Offers Search
							Element:li
							Element:a
								#Offers Detail
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Offers Search allows you to find multiple offers by "what" and "where", but does not return detailed information about each offer. Offers Detail allows you to obtain information about a particular offer, such as location, how to redeem, start and expiration dates, etc.
