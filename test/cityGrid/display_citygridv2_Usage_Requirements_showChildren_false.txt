Every web page on a Publisher Application which displays any Licensed Content must also clearly attribute the source of such content to CityGrid using the Marks provided by CityGrid and include the phrase “powered by CityGrid; data from Infogroup ©[YEAR]” on such page. For more details please review the

If You desire to append tracking to any links that directs the End User back to CityGrid, an onclick event may be added to append the appropriate tracking (e.g., PublisherID=) to the link. For more details please review the
										Element:a
											Documentation
											. At no time is the tracking parameter to be added to the href within the source anchor element.
