								The CityGrid Budget API allows publishers to discover the advertisers with budget available to them in the network and check the available remaining budget of a particular advertiser. Publishers who wish to check budgets must use this API so their quality score is unaffected by too many queries without subsequent clicks or user actions.

											Connecting
									Node:

										Element:p
											To connect to the Discovery API, form an HTTP request and download the response file. You must keep the connection open while you are downloading the file. This may be different for every language or framework.

										Element:p
											We will maintain the connection open until you close it but in some cases we may close your connection:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											Too many connections are open for the same publisher code. There is no need to download the files multiple times in parallel since the result will be the same.
										Element:li
											A client stops reading data suddenly. This probably means your connection got lost so we will close it for you
										Element:li
											A server is restarted. This may happen in the case of a new release that needs system down time, but they are not frequent
