					Each entity on Business Profiles has a "Universal ID", which uniquely identifies every company in our database. The Universal ID consists of a 2-5 character abbreviation for the jurisdiction (e.g. "CA" for California), followed by a dash, followed by the internal identifier for that business (i.e. the file number assigned to the entity by the relevant state or federal government agency). If the Universal ID of the venue is known, the details for a single entity can be requested with the details method, accessible at
				Element:strong
					/entities/details.json
					. The method takes one required parameter, universal_id. This method is useful if you have stored the ID locally and would like to request current information.
