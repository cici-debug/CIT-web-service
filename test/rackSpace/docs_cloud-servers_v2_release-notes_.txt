											XML examples have been removed. The XML serialization format for API request and response bodies is no longer supported by OpenStack. To stay consistent with OpenStack (and industry trends in general), Rackspace has deprecated the use of XML request and response bodies. New code using the Compute API should not use XML, and current programs using XML should prepare for the end of XML support. The date when Rackspace will remove XML support from the Compute API will be announced soon.

										Element:ul
										Element:li
											Two new flavor classes have replaced the Performance flavor classes:
										Element:strong
											General Purpose v1
											(like Performance 1 but with combined data and system disk) and
										Element:strong
											IO v1
											(like Performance 2).
										Element:li
											Two existing flavors classes (Performance 1 and Performance 2) have been removed from the Cloud Control Panel, but they are still visible in the API.
										Element:li
											Two new flavor classes have been added:
										Element:strong
											Compute v1
											and
										Element:strong
											Memory v1
											.
										Element:li
											At a future date, the Standard, Performance 1, and Performance 2 flavor classes will be discontinued.

											OnMetal servers have been introduced. OnMetal extends Rackspace Cloud Servers to support single-tenant, bare-metal, high-end hardware specialized to deliver outstanding performance for the key workloads typically seen in web applications. These servers can be provisioned within minutes via the Cloud Servers API, similar to any other cloud instance.
										Element:p
											Significant differences between virtual cloud servers and OnMetal cloud servers are as follows:
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											OnMetal servers are created using special flavors and images.
										Element:li
											Private networks are not currently available for OnMetal servers.
										Element:li
											OnMetal servers must be created using key pairs, and the admin password provided at creation should be neither used nor modified.
										Element:li
											Some server actions, like rebuild, resize, rescue, and so on, are not applicable to OnMetal servers.
										Element:li
										Element:p
											The tables of images and flavors have been updated.

											A new authentication endpoint has been added.
										Element:blockquote
										Element:p
											To authenticate, you issue a request to the Rackspace Cloud Identity Service, which is an implementation of the OpenStack Keystone Identity Service v2.0. Customers with UK-based accounts can now issue a
										Element:strong
											POST
										Element:strong
											/tokens
											request to the Rackspace Cloud Identity Service at the
										Element:a
											https://lon.identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0
											endpoint to authenticate access to either the first generation Cloud Servers or next generation Cloud Servers services.
										Element:p
											In response to valid credentials, an authentication request to the Rackspace Cloud Identity Service v2 returns an authentication token and a service catalog.
										Element:li
										Element:p
											Both first generation and next generation Cloud Servers services now appear in the service catalog.
										Element:p
											In the service catalog, the Cloud Servers services are named as follows:
										Element:table
										Element:colgroup
										Element:col
										Element:col
										Element:thead
										Element:tr

										Element:tbody
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											First generation
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code

											If you use the authentication token to access this service, you can view and perform first generation Cloud Servers API operations against your first generation servers.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											Next generation
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
										Element:span
											cloudServersOpenStack
										Element:p
											If you use the authentication token to access this service, you can view and perform next generation Cloud Servers API operations against your next generation servers.
										Element:p
											Next generation servers might show multiple endpoints to enable regional choice. Select the appropriate endpoint for the region that you want to interact with by examining the
										Element:code
											field.

											The 256 MB flavor has been removed from the next generation Cloud Servers. While these small instances were appropriate in certain cases, they often caused performance problems for applications and placed undue stress on underlying host machines. This change reduces the number of application performance issues and improves the overall Cloud Servers experience.
										Element:li
											Next generation Cloud Servers now implements a single vCPU allocation scheme across all operating systems. Unlike the earlier vCPU allocation scheme, which was optimized for burst on Linux and for CPU consistency on Windows, the new scheme favors consistent CPU performance while retaining some burst potential. The number of vCPUs is reduced for some flavors and increased for others to simplify Cloud Servers while balancing predictability and value.
										Element:li
											OpenStack ready. Rackspace continuously integrates with OpenStack code, which means that you have nearly immediate access to product enhancements from the OpenStack community.

											Version 2.0 of the Rackspace Cloud Servers API uses Open Software Foundation (OSF) Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) instead of integers for object IDs for images, servers, and so on. The version 1.0 used integer IDs. For example, an ID in version 1.0 might be
										Element:code
											, while in the API v2, the ID might be
										Element:span
											2
										Element:code
											.
										Element:span

										Element:li
											Third-party clients can now access the server directly through a server access IP address.
										Element:li
											The following Rackspace extensions have been added.
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											Bandwidth stats extension, which shows bandwidth usage statistics for a given audit period
										Element:li
											Disk configuration extension, which enables control of how the disk is partitioned when a server is created, rebuilt, or resized
										Element:li
											Rescue mode extension, which creates a new server with the file system for the specified version of Cloud Servers mounted to fix file system and configuration errors
										Element:li
											Used limits extension, which returns the amount of absolute limit capacity that is currently used
										Element:li
											Volume attachment extension, which, in conjunction with Cloud Block Storage API operations, enables you to attach a volume to a server instance, list volume attachments for a server instance, get volume details for a volume attachment, and delete a volume attachment
										Element:li
											Image metadata and metadata management operations have been added.
										Element:li
											IPv6 support has been added. When you create a server, an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address block are assigned. The IPv4 address and IPv6 address block are used for the public interface (Internet). The IPv4 address is also used for the private interface.
										Element:li
											Authentication now occurs through the Rackspace Cloud Identity Service, which integrates with the Rackspace infrastructure and is a modification of the OpenStack Keystone authentication specification.
										Element:li
											The Rackspace Next Generation Cloud Servers API v2.0 is based on the OpenStack Compute API v2, which differs significantly from the Rackspace First Generation Cloud Servers API v1.0.
										Element:li
											The defaults for rate limits have changed. You can request Rackspace to either raise or lower the limits as needed.
