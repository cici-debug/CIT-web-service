											Versioning
										Element:a

									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Each indexed document is given a version number. The associated
										Element:code
											version
											number is returned as part of the response to the index API request. The index API optionally allows for
										Element:a
											optimistic concurrency control
											when the
										Element:code
											version
											parameter is specified. This will control the version of the document the operation is intended to be executed against. A good example of a use case for versioning is performing a transactional read-then-update. Specifying a
										Element:code
											version
											from the document initially read ensures no changes have happened in the meantime (when reading in order to update, it is recommended to set
										Element:code
											preference
											to
										Element:code
											_primary
											). For example:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											PUT twitter/tweet/1?version=2 { "message" : "elasticsearch now has versioning support, double cool!" }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:span
											versioning is completely real time, and is not affected by the near real time aspects of search operations. If no version is provided, then the operation is executed without any version checks.
										Element:strong
											NOTE:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											By default, internal versioning is used that starts at 1 and increments with each update, deletes included. Optionally, the version number can be supplemented with an external value (for example, if maintained in a database). To enable this functionality,
										Element:code
											version_type
											should be set to
										Element:code
											external
											. The value provided must be a numeric, long value greater or equal to 0, and less than around 9.2e+18. When using the external version type, instead of checking for a matching version number, the system checks to see if the version number passed to the index request is greater than the version of the currently stored document. If true, the document will be indexed and the new version number used. If the value provided is less than or equal to the stored document’s version number, a version conflict will occur and the index operation will fail.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											External versioning supports the value 0 as a valid version number. This allows the version to be in sync with an external versioning system where version numbers start from zero instead of one. It has the side effect that documents with version number equal to zero cannot neither be updated using the
										Element:a
											Update-By-Query API
											nor be deleted using the
										Element:a
											Delete By Query API
											as long as their version number is equal to zero.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											A nice side effect is that there is no need to maintain strict ordering of async indexing operations executed as a result of changes to a source database, as long as version numbers from the source database are used. Even the simple case of updating the elasticsearch index using data from a database is simplified if external versioning is used, as only the latest version will be used if the index operations are out of order for whatever reason.

											By default, shard placement — or

											— is controlled by using a hash of the document’s id value. For more explicit control, the value fed into the hash function used by the router can be directly specified on a per-operation basis using the
										Element:code
											routing
											parameter. For example:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											POST twitter/tweet?routing=kimchy { "user" : "kimchy", "post_date" : "2009-11-15T14:12:12", "message" : "trying out Elasticsearch" }

											When setting up explicit mapping, the

											Wait For Active Shards
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To improve the resiliency of writes to the system, indexing operations can be configured to wait for a certain number of active shard copies before proceeding with the operation. If the requisite number of active shard copies are not available, then the write operation must wait and retry, until either the requisite shard copies have started or a timeout occurs. By default, write operations only wait for the primary shards to be active before proceeding (i.e.
										Element:code
											wait_for_active_shards=1
											). This default can be overridden in the index settings dynamically by setting
										Element:code
											index.write.wait_for_active_shards
											. To alter this behavior per operation, the
										Element:code
											wait_for_active_shards
											request parameter can be used.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Valid values are
										Element:code
											all
											or any positive integer up to the total number of configured copies per shard in the index (which is
										Element:code
											number_of_replicas+1
											). Specifying a negative value or a number greater than the number of shard copies will throw an error.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											For example, suppose we have a cluster of three nodes,
										Element:code
											A
											,
										Element:code
											B
											, and
										Element:code
											C
											and we create an index
										Element:code
											index
											with the number of replicas set to 3 (resulting in 4 shard copies, one more copy than there are nodes). If we attempt an indexing operation, by default the operation will only ensure the primary copy of each shard is available before proceeding. This means that even if
										Element:code
											B
											and
										Element:code
											C
											went down, and
										Element:code
											A
											hosted the primary shard copies, the indexing operation would still proceed with only one copy of the data. If
										Element:code
											wait_for_active_shards
											is set on the request to
										Element:code
											3
											(and all 3 nodes are up), then the indexing operation will require 3 active shard copies before proceeding, a requirement which should be met because there are 3 active nodes in the cluster, each one holding a copy of the shard. However, if we set
										Element:code
											wait_for_active_shards
											to
										Element:code
											all
											(or to
										Element:code
											4
											, which is the same), the indexing operation will not proceed as we do not have all 4 copies of each shard active in the index. The operation will timeout unless a new node is brought up in the cluster to host the fourth copy of the shard.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											It is important to note that this setting greatly reduces the chances of the write operation not writing to the requisite number of shard copies, but it does not completely eliminate the possibility, because this check occurs before the write operation commences. Once the write operation is underway, it is still possible for replication to fail on any number of shard copies but still succeed on the primary. The
										Element:code
											_shards
											section of the write operation’s response reveals the number of shard copies on which replication succeeded/failed.

											When updating a document using the index api a new version of the document is always created even if the document hasn’t changed. If this isn’t acceptable use the
										Element:code
											_update
											api with
										Element:code
											detect_noop
											set to true. This option isn’t available on the index api because the index api doesn’t fetch the old source and isn’t able to compare it against the new source.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											There isn’t a hard and fast rule about when noop updates aren’t acceptable. It’s a combination of lots of factors like how frequently your data source sends updates that are actually noops and how many queries per second elasticsearch runs on the shard with receiving the updates.

											The primary shard assigned to perform the index operation might not be available when the index operation is executed. Some reasons for this might be that the primary shard is currently recovering from a gateway or undergoing relocation. By default, the index operation will wait on the primary shard to become available for up to 1 minute before failing and responding with an error. The
										Element:code
											timeout
											parameter can be used to explicitly specify how long it waits. Here is an example of setting it to 5 minutes:
									Node:
