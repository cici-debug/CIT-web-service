											Previous versions of Elasticsearch defaulted to allowing multiple nodes to share the same data directory (up to 50). This can be confusing where users accidentally startup multiple nodes and end up thinking that they’ve lost data because the second node will start with an empty data directory. While the default of allowing multiple nodes is friendly to playing with forming a small cluster on a laptop, and end-users do sometimes run multiple nodes on the same host, this tends to be the exception. Keeping with Elasticsearch’s continual movement towards safer out-of-the-box defaults, and optimizing for the norm instead of the exception, the default for

											Previously script mode settings (e.g., "script.inline: true", "script.engine.groovy.inline.aggs: false", etc.) accepted a wide range of "truthy" or "falsy" values. This is now much stricter and supports only the
										Element:code
											true
											and
										Element:code
											false
											options.

											Prior to 5.0 a third option could be specified for the

											script.inline
											and
