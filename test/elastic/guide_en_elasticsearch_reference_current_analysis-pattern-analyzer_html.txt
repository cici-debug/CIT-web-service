											.
										Element:tr
										Element:td

											In this example, we configure the
										Element:code
											pattern
											analyzer to split email addresses on non-word characters or on underscores (
										Element:code
											\W|_
											), and to lower-case the result:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											PUT my_index { "settings": { "analysis": { "analyzer": { "my_email_analyzer": { "type": "pattern", "pattern": "\\W|_",
										Element:a
										Element:span
											"lowercase": true } } } } } POST my_index/_analyze { "analyzer": "my_email_analyzer", "text": "John_Smith@foo-bar.com" }
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The backslashes in the pattern need to be escaped when specifying the pattern as a JSON string.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The above example produces the following terms:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											[ john, smith, foo, bar, com ]

														PUT my_index { "settings": { "analysis": { "analyzer": { "camel": { "type": "pattern", "pattern": "([^\\p{L}\\d]+)|(?<=\\D)(?=\\d)|(?<=\\d)(?=\\D)|(?<=[\\p{L}&&[^\\p{Lu}]])(?=\\p{Lu})|(?<=\\p{Lu})(?=\\p{Lu}[\\p{L}&&[^\\p{Lu}]])" } } } } } GET my_index/_analyze { "analyzer": "camel", "text": "MooseX::FTPClass2_beta" }
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4

														The above example produces the following terms:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														[ moose, x, ftp, class, 2, beta ]
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4

														The regex above is easier to understand as:
												Node:

												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														([^\p{L}\d]+) # swallow non letters and numbers, | (?<=\D)(?=\d) # or non-number followed by number, | (?<=\d)(?=\D) # or number followed by non-number, | (?<=[ \p{L} && [^\p{Lu}]]) # or lower case (?=\p{Lu}) # followed by upper case, | (?<=\p{Lu}) # or upper case (?=\p{Lu} # followed by upper case [\p{L}&&[^\p{Lu}]] # then lower case )
