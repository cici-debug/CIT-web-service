								A
							Element:code
								single-value
								metrics aggregation that keeps track and returns the minimum value among numeric values extracted from the aggregated documents. These values can be extracted either from specific numeric fields in the documents, or be generated by a provided script.

								The
							Element:code
								min
								and
							Element:code
								max
								aggregation operate on the
							Element:code
								double
								representation of the data. As a consequence, the result may be approximate when running on longs whose absolute value is greater than
							Element:code
								2^53
								.
						Node:

								Computing the min price value across all documents:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "aggs" : { "min_price" : { "min" : { "field" : "price" } } } }
						Node:

								Response:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ ... "aggregations": { "min_price": { "value": 10 } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								As can be seen, the name of the aggregation (
							Element:code
								min_price
								above) also serves as the key by which the aggregation result can be retrieved from the returned response.

											Computing the min price value across all document, this time using a script:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "aggs" : { "min_price" : { "min" : { "script" : { "inline" : "doc['price'].value", "lang" : "painless" } } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This will interpret the
										Element:code
											script
											parameter as an
										Element:code
											inline
											script with the
										Element:code
											painless
											script language and no script parameters. To use a file script use the following syntax:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "aggs" : { "min_price" : { "min" : { "script" : { "file": "my_script", "params": { "field": "price" } } } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											for indexed scripts replace the
										Element:code
											file
											parameter with an
										Element:code
											id
											parameter.

										Element:p
											Let’s say that the prices of the documents in our index are in USD, but we would like to compute the min in EURO (and for the sake of this example, lets say the conversion rate is 1.2). We can use a value script to apply the conversion rate to every value before it is aggregated:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "aggs" : { "min_price_in_euros" : { "min" : { "field" : "price", "script" : "lang" : "painless", "inline": "_value * params.conversion_rate", "params" : { "conversion_rate" : 1.2 } } } } } }

											Missing value
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											missing
											parameter defines how documents that are missing a value should be treated. By default they will be ignored but it is also possible to treat them as if they had a value.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "aggs" : { "grade_min" : { "min" : { "field" : "grade", "missing": 10
										Element:a
										Element:span
											} } } }

									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Documents without a value in the
										Element:code
											grade
											field will fall into the same bucket as documents that have the value
										Element:code
											10
											.
