								Individual fields can be

								boosted
							Element:code
								boost
								parameter as follows:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								PUT my_index { "mappings": { "my_type": { "properties": { "title": { "type": "text", "boost": 2
							Element:a

							Element:a

								Matches on the

								title
								field will have twice the weight as those on the
							Element:code
								content
								field, which has the default
							Element:code
								boost
								of
							Element:code
								1.0
								.

								The boost is applied only for term queries (prefix, range and fuzzy queries are not
							Element:span
								).
							Element:em
								boosted
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can achieve the same effect by using the boost parameter directly in the query, for instance the following query (with field time boost):
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								POST _search { "query": { "match" : { "title": { "query": "quick brown fox" } } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								is equivalent to:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								POST _search { "query": { "match" : { "title": { "query": "quick brown fox", "boost": 2 } } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The boost is also applied when it is copied with the value in the
							Element:a
								field. This means that, when querying the
							Element:code
								_all
							Element:code
								_all
								field, words that originated from the
							Element:code
								title
								field will have a higher score than words that originated in the
							Element:code
								content
								field. This functionality comes at a cost: queries on the
							Element:code
								_all
								field are slower when field boosting is used.

											Deprecated in 5.0.0.
											index time boost is deprecated. Instead, the field mapping boost is applied at query time. For indices created before 5.0.0 the boost will still be applied at index time.

											Why index time boosting is a bad idea
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											We advise against using index time boosting for the following reasons:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											You cannot change index-time
										Element:code
											boost
											values without reindexing all of your documents.
										Element:li
											Every query supports query-time boosting which achieves the same effect. The difference is that you can tweak the
										Element:code
											boost
											value without having to reindex.
										Element:li
											Index-time boosts are stored as part of the
										Element:a
											, which is only one byte. This reduces the resolution of the field length normalization factor which can lead to lower quality relevance calculations.
