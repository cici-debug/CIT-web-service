						Node:

								The

								term
								suggester suggests terms based on edit distance. The provided suggest text is analyzed before terms are suggested. The suggested terms are provided per analyzed suggest text token. The
							Element:code
								term
								suggester doesn’t take the query into account that is part of request.

										Element:tr

										Element:td
										Element:p
											The maximum corrections to be returned per suggest text token.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											sort
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Defines how suggestions should be sorted per suggest text term. Two possible values:
										Element:ul
										Element:li
										Element:code
											score
											: Sort by score first, then document frequency and then the term itself.
										Element:li
										Element:code
											frequency
											: Sort by document frequency first, then similarity score and then the term itself.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											suggest_mode
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The suggest mode controls what suggestions are included or controls for what suggest text terms, suggestions should be suggested. Three possible values can be specified:
										Element:ul
										Element:li
										Element:code
											missing
											: Only provide suggestions for suggest text terms that are not in the index. This is the default.
										Element:li
										Element:code
											popular
											: Only suggest suggestions that occur in more docs than the original suggest text term.
										Element:li
										Element:code
											always
											: Suggest any matching suggestions based on terms in the suggest text.

										Element:tr

										Element:code
											max_edits
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The maximum edit distance candidate suggestions can have in order to be considered as a suggestion. Can only be a value between 1 and 2. Any other value result in an bad request error being thrown. Defaults to 2.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											prefix_length
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The number of minimal prefix characters that must match in order be a candidate suggestions. Defaults to 1. Increasing this number improves spellcheck performance. Usually misspellings don’t occur in the beginning of terms. (Old name "prefix_len" is deprecated)
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											min_word_length
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The minimum length a suggest text term must have in order to be included. Defaults to 4. (Old name "min_word_len" is deprecated)
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											shard_size
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Sets the maximum number of suggestions to be retrieved from each individual shard. During the reduce phase only the top N suggestions are returned based on the
										Element:code
											size
											option. Defaults to the
										Element:code
											size
											option. Setting this to a value higher than the
										Element:code
											size
											can be useful in order to get a more accurate document frequency for spelling corrections at the cost of performance. Due to the fact that terms are partitioned amongst shards, the shard level document frequencies of spelling corrections may not be precise. Increasing this will make these document frequencies more precise.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											max_inspections
										Element:td
										Element:p
											A factor that is used to multiply with the
										Element:code
											shards_size
											in order to inspect more candidate spell corrections on the shard level. Can improve accuracy at the cost of performance. Defaults to 5.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											min_doc_freq
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The minimal threshold in number of documents a suggestion should appear in. This can be specified as an absolute number or as a relative percentage of number of documents. This can improve quality by only suggesting high frequency terms. Defaults to 0f and is not enabled. If a value higher than 1 is specified then the number cannot be fractional. The shard level document frequencies are used for this option.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											max_term_freq
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The maximum threshold in number of documents a suggest text token can exist in order to be included. Can be a relative percentage number (e.g 0.4) or an absolute number to represent document frequencies. If an value higher than 1 is specified then fractional can not be specified. Defaults to 0.01f. This can be used to exclude high frequency terms from being spellchecked. High frequency terms are usually spelled correctly on top of this also improves the spellcheck performance. The shard level document frequencies are used for this option.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											string_distance
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Which string distance implementation to use for comparing how similar suggested terms are. Five possible values can be specified:
										Element:code
											internal
											- The default based on damerau_levenshtein but highly optimized for comparing string distance for terms inside the index.
										Element:code
											damerau_levenshtein
											- String distance algorithm based on Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm.
										Element:code
											levenstein
											- String distance algorithm based on Levenstein edit distance algorithm.
										Element:code
											jarowinkler
											- String distance algorithm based on Jaro-Winkler algorithm.
										Element:code
											ngram
											- String distance algorithm based on character n-grams.
