								Elasticsearch contains multiple circuit breakers used to prevent operations from causing an OutOfMemoryError. Each breaker specifies a limit for how much memory it can use. Additionally, there is a parent-level breaker that specifies the total amount of memory that can be used across all breakers.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								These settings can be dynamically updated on a live cluster with the
							Element:a
								cluster-update-settings
								API.

												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:dl
													Element:dt
													Element:span
													Element:code
														indices.breaker.total.limit
													Element:dd
														Starting limit for overall parent breaker, defaults to 70% of JVM heap.

														Field data circuit breaker
													Element:a
														edit
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The field data circuit breaker allows Elasticsearch to estimate the amount of memory a field will require to be loaded into memory. It can then prevent the field data loading by raising an exception. By default the limit is configured to 60% of the maximum JVM heap. It can be configured with the following parameters:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:dl
													Element:dt
													Element:span
													Element:code
														indices.breaker.fielddata.limit
													Element:dd
														Limit for fielddata breaker, defaults to 60% of JVM heap
													Element:dt
													Element:span
													Element:code
														indices.breaker.fielddata.overhead
													Element:dd
														A constant that all field data estimations are multiplied with to determine a final estimation. Defaults to 1.03

														Request circuit breaker
													Element:a
														edit
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The request circuit breaker allows Elasticsearch to prevent per-request data structures (for example, memory used for calculating aggregations during a request) from exceeding a certain amount of memory.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:dl
													Element:dt
													Element:span
													Element:code
														indices.breaker.request.limit
													Element:dd
														Limit for request breaker, defaults to 60% of JVM heap
													Element:dt
													Element:span
													Element:code
														indices.breaker.request.overhead
													Element:dd
														A constant that all request estimations are multiplied with to determine a final estimation. Defaults to 1

														In flight requests circuit breaker
													Element:a
														edit
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The in flight requests circuit breaker allows Elasticsearch to limit the memory usage of all currently active incoming requests on transport or HTTP level from exceeding a certain amount of memory on a node. The memory usage is based on the content length of the request itself.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:dl
													Element:dt
													Element:span
													Element:code
														network.breaker.inflight_requests.limit
													Element:dd
														Limit for in flight requests breaker, defaults to 100% of JVM heap. This means that it is bound by the limit configured for the parent circuit breaker.
													Element:dt
													Element:span
													Element:code
														network.breaker.inflight_requests.overhead
													Element:dd
														A constant that all in flight requests estimations are multiplied with to determine a final estimation. Defaults to 1

														Script compilation circuit breaker

														edit
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Slightly different than the previous memory-based circuit breaker, the script compilation circuit breaker limits the number of inline script compilations within a period of time.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														See the "prefer-parameters" section of the
													Element:a
														scripting
														documentation for more information.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:dl
													Element:dt
													Element:span
													Element:code
														script.max_compilations_per_minute
													Element:dd
														Limit for the number of unique dynamic scripts within a minute that are allowed to be compiled. Defaults to 15.
