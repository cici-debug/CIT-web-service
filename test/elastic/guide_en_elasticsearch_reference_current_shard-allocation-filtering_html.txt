						Node:

								Shard allocation filtering allows you to specify which nodes are allowed to host the shards of a particular index.
						Node:
						(type) c

						Node:

							Element:p
								The per-index shard allocation filters explained below work in conjunction with the cluster-wide allocation filters explained in
							Element:a
								Cluster Level Shard Allocation
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								It is possible to assign arbitrary metadata attributes to each node at startup. For instance, nodes could be assigned a
							Element:code
								rack
								and a
							Element:code
								size
								attribute as follows:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								bin/elasticsearch -Enode.attr.rack=rack1 -Enode.attr.size=big
							Element:a
							Element:span
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:table
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:a
							Element:span
							Element:img
							Element:td
							Element:p
								These attribute settings can also be specified in the
							Element:code
								elasticsearch.yml
								config file.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								These metadata attributes can be used with the
							Element:code
								index.routing.allocation.*
								settings to allocate an index to a particular group of nodes. For instance, we can move the index
							Element:code
								test
								to either
							Element:code
								big
								or
							Element:code
								medium
								nodes as follows:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								PUT test/_settings { "index.routing.allocation.include.size": "big,medium" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Alternatively, we can move the index
							Element:code
								test
								away from the
							Element:code
								small
								nodes with an
							Element:code
								exclude
								rule:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								PUT test/_settings { "index.routing.allocation.exclude.size": "small" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Multiple rules can be specified, in which case all conditions must be satisfied. For instance, we could move the index
							Element:code
								test
								to
							Element:code
								big
								nodes in
							Element:code
								rack1
								with the following:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								PUT test/_settings { "index.routing.allocation.include.size": "big", "index.routing.allocation.include.rack": "rack1" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If some conditions cannot be satisfied then shards will not be moved.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The following settings are
							Element:span
								, allowing live indices to be moved from one set of nodes to another:
							Element:em
								dynamic
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:dl
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								index.routing.allocation.include.{attribute}
							Element:dd
								Assign the index to a node whose
							Element:code
								{attribute}
								has at least one of the comma-separated values.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								index.routing.allocation.require.{attribute}
							Element:dd
								Assign the index to a node whose
							Element:code
								{attribute}
								has
							Element:span
								of the comma-separated values.
							Element:em
								all
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								index.routing.allocation.exclude.{attribute}
							Element:dd
								Assign the index to a node whose
							Element:code
								{attribute}
								has
							Element:span
								of the comma-separated values.
							Element:em
								none

								Match nodes by publish IP address
							Element:tr

								_host

								Match nodes by hostname

								All attribute values can be specified with wildcards, eg:
