								The Profile API provides detailed timing information about the execution of individual components in a search request. It gives the user insight into how search requests are executed at a low level so that the user can understand why certain requests are slow, and take steps to improve them.

											Any

											GET /_search { "profile": true,

											Even for a simple query, the response is relatively complicated. Let’s break it down piece-by-piece before moving to more complex examples.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											First, the overall structure of the profile response is as follows:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "profile": { "shards": [ { "id": "[2aE02wS1R8q_QFnYu6vDVQ][twitter][1]",
										Element:a
										Element:span
											"searches": [ { "query": [...],
										Element:img
										Element:a
										Element:span
											"rewrite_time": 51443,
										Element:img
										Element:a
										Element:span
											"collector": [...]
										Element:img
										Element:a
										Element:span
											} ], "aggregations": [...]
										Element:img
										Element:a
										Element:span
											} ] } }
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td
										Element:p
											A profile is returned for each shard that participated in the response, and is identified by a unique ID
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Each profile contains a section which holds details about the query execution
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Each profile has a single time representing the cumulative rewrite time
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Each profile also contains a section about the Lucene Collectors which run the search
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Each profile contains a section which holds the details about the aggregation execution
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Because a search request may be executed against one or more shards in an index, and a search may cover one or more indices, the top level element in the profile response is an array of
										Element:code
											shard
											objects. Each shard object lists it’s
										Element:code
											id
											which uniquely identifies the shard. The ID’s format is
										Element:code
											[nodeID][indexName][shardID]
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The profile itself may consist of one or more "searches", where a search is a query executed against the underlying Lucene index. Most Search Requests submitted by the user will only execute a single
										Element:code
											search
											against the Lucene index. But occasionally multiple searches will be executed, such as including a global aggregation (which needs to execute a secondary "match_all" query for the global context).
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Inside each
										Element:code
											search
											object there will be two arrays of profiled information: a
										Element:code
											query
											array and a
										Element:code
											collector
											array. Alongside the
										Element:code
											search
											object is an
										Element:code
											aggregations
											object that contains the profile information for the aggregations. In the future, more sections may be added, such as
										Element:code
											suggest
											,
										Element:code
											highlight
											, etc
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											There will also be a
										Element:code
											rewrite
											metric showing the total time spent rewriting the query (in nanoseconds).
