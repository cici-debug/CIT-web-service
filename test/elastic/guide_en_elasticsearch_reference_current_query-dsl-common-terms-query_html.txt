														The problem
													Element:a
														edit
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Every term in a query has a cost. A search for
													Element:code
														"The brown fox"
														requires three term queries, one for each of
													Element:code
														"the"
														,
													Element:code
														"brown"
														and
													Element:code
														"fox"
														, all of which are executed against all documents in the index. The query for
													Element:code
														"the"
														is likely to match many documents and thus has a much smaller impact on relevance than the other two terms.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Previously, the solution to this problem was to ignore terms with high frequency. By treating
													Element:code
														"the"
														as a
													Element:span
														, we reduce the index size and reduce the number of term queries that need to be executed.
													Element:em
														stopword
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The problem with this approach is that, while stopwords have a small impact on relevance, they are still important. If we remove stopwords, we lose precision, (eg we are unable to distinguish between
													Element:code
														"happy"
														and
													Element:code
														"not happy"
														) and we lose recall (eg text like
													Element:code
														"The The"
														or
													Element:code
														"To be or not to be"
														would simply not exist in the index).

														The solution
													Element:a
														edit
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The
													Element:code
														common
														terms query divides the query terms into two groups: more important (ie
													Element:span
														terms) and less important (ie
													Element:em
														low frequency
													Element:span
														terms which would previously have been stopwords).
													Element:em
														high frequency
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														First it searches for documents which match the more important terms. These are the terms which appear in fewer documents and have a greater impact on relevance.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Then, it executes a second query for the less important terms — terms which appear frequently and have a low impact on relevance. But instead of calculating the relevance score for
													Element:span
														matching documents, it only calculates the
													Element:strong
														all
													Element:code
														_score
														for documents already matched by the first query. In this way the high frequency terms can improve the relevance calculation without paying the cost of poor performance.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														If a query consists only of high frequency terms, then a single query is executed as an
													Element:code
														AND
														(conjunction) query, in other words all terms are required. Even though each individual term will match many documents, the combination of terms narrows down the resultset to only the most relevant. The single query can also be executed as an
													Element:code
														OR
														with a specific
													Element:a
														, in this case a high enough value should probably be used.
													Element:code
														minimum_should_match
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Terms are allocated to the high or low frequency groups based on the
													Element:code
														cutoff_frequency
														, which can be specified as an absolute frequency (
													Element:code
														>=1
														) or as a relative frequency (
													Element:code
														0.0 .. 1.0
														). (Remember that document frequencies are computed on a per shard level as explained in the blog post
													Element:a
														Relevance is broken
														.)
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Perhaps the most interesting property of this query is that it adapts to domain specific stopwords automatically. For example, on a video hosting site, common terms like
													Element:code
														"clip"
														or
													Element:code
														"video"
														will automatically behave as stopwords without the need to maintain a manual list.

														In this example, words that have a document frequency greater than 0.1% (eg

														The number of terms which should match can be controlled with the
													Element:a
														(
													Element:code
														minimum_should_match
													Element:code
														high_freq
														,
													Element:code
														low_freq
														),
													Element:code
														low_freq_operator
														(default
													Element:code
														"or"
														) and
													Element:code
														high_freq_operator
														(default
													Element:code
														"or"
														) parameters.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														For low frequency terms, set the
													Element:code
														low_freq_operator
														to
													Element:code
														"and"
														to make all terms required:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														GET /_search { "query": { "common": { "body": { "query": "nelly the elephant as a cartoon", "cutoff_frequency": 0.001, "low_freq_operator": "and" } } } }
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														which is roughly equivalent to:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														GET /_search { "query": { "bool": { "must": [ { "term": { "body": "nelly"}}, { "term": { "body": "elephant"}}, { "term": { "body": "cartoon"}} ], "should": [ { "term": { "body": "the"}}, { "term": { "body": "as"}}, { "term": { "body": "a"}} ] } } }
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Alternatively use
													Element:a
														to specify a minimum number or percentage of low frequency terms which must be present, for instance:
													Element:code
														minimum_should_match
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														GET /_search { "query": { "common": { "body": { "query": "nelly the elephant as a cartoon", "cutoff_frequency": 0.001, "minimum_should_match": 2 } } } }
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														which is roughly equivalent to:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														GET /_search { "query": { "bool": { "must": { "bool": { "should": [ { "term": { "body": "nelly"}}, { "term": { "body": "elephant"}}, { "term": { "body": "cartoon"}} ], "minimum_should_match": 2 } }, "should": [ { "term": { "body": "the"}}, { "term": { "body": "as"}}, { "term": { "body": "a"}} ] } } }

														A different
													Element:a
														can be applied for low and high frequency terms with the additional
													Element:code
														minimum_should_match
													Element:code
														low_freq
														and
													Element:code
														high_freq
														parameters. Here is an example when providing additional parameters (note the change in structure):
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														GET /_search { "query": { "common": { "body": { "query": "nelly the elephant not as a cartoon", "cutoff_frequency": 0.001, "minimum_should_match": { "low_freq" : 2, "high_freq" : 3 } } } } }
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														which is roughly equivalent to:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														GET /_search { "query": { "bool": { "must": { "bool": { "should": [ { "term": { "body": "nelly"}}, { "term": { "body": "elephant"}}, { "term": { "body": "cartoon"}} ], "minimum_should_match": 2 } }, "should": { "bool": { "should": [ { "term": { "body": "the"}}, { "term": { "body": "not"}}, { "term": { "body": "as"}}, { "term": { "body": "a"}} ], "minimum_should_match": 3 } } } } }
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														In this case it means the high frequency terms have only an impact on relevance when there are at least three of them. But the most interesting use of the
													Element:a
														for high frequency terms is when there are only high frequency terms:
													Element:code
														minimum_should_match
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														GET /_search { "query": { "common": { "body": { "query": "how not to be", "cutoff_frequency": 0.001, "minimum_should_match": { "low_freq" : 2, "high_freq" : 3 } } } } }
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														which is roughly equivalent to:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														GET /_search { "query": { "bool": { "should": [ { "term": { "body": "how"}}, { "term": { "body": "not"}}, { "term": { "body": "to"}}, { "term": { "body": "be"}} ], "minimum_should_match": "3<50%" } } }
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The high frequency generated query is then slightly less restrictive than with an
													Element:code
														AND
														.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p

													Element:code
														common
