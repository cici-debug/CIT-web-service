								Wherever scripting is supported in the Elasticsearch API, the syntax follows the same pattern:

						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								"script": { "lang": "...",
							Element:a
							Element:span
								"inline" | "stored" | "file": "...",

											is retrieved from the cluster state (see

											script is retrieved from a file in the

											While languages like

											and

											can be used out of the box as inline or stored scripts, other languages like

											The first time Elasticsearch sees a new script, it compiles it and stores the compiled version in a cache. Compilation can be a heavy process.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you need to pass variables into the script, you should pass them in as named
										Element:code
											params
											instead of hard-coding values into the script itself. For example, if you want to be able to multiply a field value by different multipliers, don’t hard-code the multiplier into the script:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											"inline": "doc['my_field'] * 2"
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Instead, pass it in as a named parameter:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											"inline": "doc['my_field'] * multiplier", "params": { "multiplier": 2 }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The first version has to be recompiled every time the multiplier changes. The second version is only compiled once.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you compile too many unique scripts within a small amount of time, Elasticsearch will reject the new dynamic scripts with a
										Element:code
											circuit_breaking_exception
											error. By default, up to 15 inline scripts per minute will be compiled. You can change this setting dynamically by setting
										Element:code
											script.max_compilations_per_minute
											.

											To increase security, non-sandboxed languages can only be specified in script files stored on every node in the cluster. File scripts must be saved in the
										Element:code
											scripts
											directory whose default location depends on whether you use the
										Element:a
											(
										Element:code
											zip
											/
										Element:code
											tar.gz
										Element:code
											$ES_HOME/config/scripts/
											),
										Element:a

											, or

											Debian
											package. The default may be changed with the
										Element:code
											path.scripts
											setting.
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:p
											The languages which are assumed to be safe by default are:
										Element:code
											painless
											,
										Element:code
											expression
											, and
										Element:code
											mustache
											(used for search and query templates).
									Node:

											Any files placed in the
										Element:code
											scripts
											directory will be compiled automatically when the node starts up and then
										Element:a
											every 60 seconds thereafter
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The file should be named as follows:
										Element:code
											{script-name}.{lang}
											. For instance, the following example creates a Groovy script called
										Element:code
											calculate-score
											:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											cat "log(_score * 2) + my_modifier" > config/scripts/calculate-score.groovy
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This script can be used as follows:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET my_index/_search { "query": { "script": { "script": { "lang": "groovy",
										Element:a
										Element:span
											"file": "calculate-score",
										Element:img
										Element:a
										Element:span
											"params": { "my_modifier": 2 } } } } }
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The language of the script, which should correspond with the script file suffix.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The name of the script, which should be the name of the file.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											script
											directory may contain sub-directories, in which case the hierarchy of directories is flattened and concatenated with underscores. A script in
										Element:code
											group1/group2/my_script.groovy
											should use
										Element:code
											group1_group2_myscript
											as the
										Element:code
											file
											name.

									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET _scripts/groovy/calculate-score
									Node:

									Node:

										Element:pre
											GET _search { "query": { "script": { "script": { "lang": "groovy", "stored": "calculate-score", "params": { "my_modifier": 2 } } } } }

											Script Caching
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											All scripts are cached by default so that they only need to be recompiled when updates occur. File scripts keep a static cache and will always reside in memory. Both inline and stored scripts are stored in a cache that can evict residing scripts. By default, scripts do not have a time-based expiration, but you can change this behavior by using the
										Element:code
											script.cache.expire
											setting. You can configure the size of this cache by using the
										Element:code
											script.cache.max_size
											setting. By default, the cache size is
										Element:code
											100
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The size of stored scripts is limited to 65,535 bytes. This can be changed by setting
										Element:code
											script.max_size_in_bytes
											setting to increase that soft limit, but if scripts are really large then alternatives like
										Element:a
											native
											scripts should be considered instead.
