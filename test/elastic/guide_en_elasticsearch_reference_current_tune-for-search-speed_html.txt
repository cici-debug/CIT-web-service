											Elasticsearch heavily relies on the filesystem cache in order to make search fast. In general, you should make sure that at least half the available memory goes to the filesystem cache so that elasticsearch can keep hot regions of the index in physical memory.

										Element:p
											If your search is I/O bound, you should investigate giving more memory to the filesystem cache (see above) or buying faster drives. In particular SSD drives are known to perform better than spinning disks. Always use local storage, remote filesystems such as
										Element:code
											NFS
											or
										Element:code
											SMB
											should be avoided. Also beware of virtualized storage such as Amazon’s
										Element:code
											Elastic Block Storage
											. Virtualized storage works very well with Elasticsearch, and it is appealing since it is so fast and simple to set up, but it is also unfortunately inherently slower on an ongoing basis when compared to dedicated local storage. If you put an index on
										Element:code
											EBS
											, be sure to use provisioned IOPS otherwise operations could be quickly throttled.

											Documents should be modeled so that search-time operations are as cheap as possible.
									Node:

										Element:p
											In particular, joins should be avoided.
										Element:a
											can make queries several times slower and
										Element:code
											nested
										Element:a
											parent-child
											relations can make queries hundreds of times slower. So if the same questions can be answered without joins by denormalizing documents, significant speedups can be expected.

											Pre-index data
										Element:a

									Node:

										Element:p
											You should leverage patterns in your queries to optimize the way data is indexed. For instance, if all your documents have a
										Element:code
											price
											field and most queries run
										Element:a
											aggregations on a fixed list of ranges, you could make this aggregation faster by pre-indexing the ranges into the index and using a
										Element:code
											range
										Element:a
											aggregations.
										Element:code
											terms
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											For instance, if documents look like:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											PUT index/type/1 { "designation": "spoon", "price": 13 }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											and search requests look like:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET index/_search { "aggs": { "price_ranges": { "range": { "field": "price", "ranges": [ { "to": 10 }, { "from": 10, "to": 100 }, { "from": 100 } ] } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Then documents could be enriched by a
										Element:code
											price_range
											field at index time, which should be mapped as a
										Element:a
											:
										Element:code
											keyword
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											PUT index { "mappings": { "type": { "properties": { "price_range": { "type": "keyword" } } } } } PUT index/type/1 { "designation": "spoon", "price": 13, "price_range": "10-100" }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											And then search requests could aggregate this new field rather than running a
										Element:code
											range
											aggregation on the
										Element:code
											price
											field.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET index/_search { "aggs": { "price_ranges": { "terms": { "field": "price_range" } } } }

											The fact that some data is numeric does not mean it should always be mapped as a
										Element:a
											numeric field
											. Typically, fields storing identifiers such as an
										Element:code
											ISBN
											or any number identifying a record from another database, might benefit from being mapped as
										Element:a
											rather than
										Element:code

										Element:code

											or

											Search rounded dates
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Queries on date fields that use
										Element:code
											now
											are typically not cacheable since the range that is being matched changes all the time. However switching to a rounded date is often acceptable in terms of user experience, and has the benefit of making better use of the query cache.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											For instance the below query:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											PUT index/type/1 { "my_date": "2016-05-11T16:30:55.328Z" } GET index/_search { "query": { "constant_score": { "filter": { "range": { "my_date": { "gte": "now-1h", "lte": "now" } } } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											could be replaced with the following query:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET index/_search { "query": { "constant_score": { "filter": { "range": { "my_date": { "gte": "now-1h/m", "lte": "now/m" } } } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In that case we rounded to the minute, so if the current time is
										Element:code
											16:31:29
											, the range query will match everything whose value of the
										Element:code
											my_date
											field is between
										Element:code
											15:31:00
											and
										Element:code
											16:31:59
											. And if several users run a query that contains this range in the same minute, the query cache could help speed things up a bit. The longer the interval that is used for rounding, the more the query cache can help, but beware that too aggressive rounding might also hurt user experience.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											It might be tempting to split ranges into a large cacheable part and smaller not cacheable parts in order to be able to leverage the query cache, as shown below:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET index/_search { "query": { "constant_score": { "filter": { "bool": { "should": [ { "range": { "my_date": { "gte": "now-1h", "lte": "now-1h/m" } } }, { "range": { "my_date": { "gt": "now-1h/m", "lt": "now/m" } } }, { "range": { "my_date": { "gte": "now/m", "lte": "now" } } } ] } } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											However such practice might make the query run slower in some cases since the overhead introduced by the
										Element:code
											bool
											query may defeat the savings from better leveraging the query cache.

									Node:

										Element:p
											Indices that are read-only would benefit from being

											Warm up global ordinals

									Node:

										Element:p
											Global ordinals are a data-structure that is used in order to run
										Element:a
											aggregations on
										Element:code
											terms
										Element:a
											fields. They are loaded lazily in memory because elasticsearch does not know which fields will be used in
										Element:code
											keyword
										Element:code
											terms
											aggregations and which fields won’t. You can tell elasticsearch to load global ordinals eagerly at refresh-time by configuring mappings as described below:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											PUT index { "mappings": { "type": { "properties": { "foo": { "type": "keyword", "eager_global_ordinals": true } } } } }

									Node:

										Element:p
											If the machine running elasticsearch is restarted, the filesystem cache will be empty, so it will take some time before the operating system loads hot regions of the index into memory so that search operations are fast. You can explicitly tell the operating system which files should be loaded into memory eagerly depending on the file extension using the
										Element:a
											setting.
