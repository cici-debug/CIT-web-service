								Assuming the data consists of documents representing stock ticks, where each tick holds the change in the stock price from the previous tick.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "query" : { "constant_score" : { "filter" : { "range" : { "timestamp" : { "from" : "now/1d+9.5h", "to" : "now/1d+16h" }} } } }, "aggs" : { "intraday_return" : { "sum" : { "field" : "change" } } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The above aggregation sums up all changes in the today’s trading stock ticks which accounts for the intraday return. The aggregation type is
							Element:code
								sum
								and the
							Element:code
								field
								setting defines the numeric field of the documents of which values will be summed up. The above will return the following:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ ... "aggregations": { "intraday_return": { "value": 2.18 } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The name of the aggregation (
							Element:code
								intraday_return
								above) also serves as the key by which the aggregation result can be retrieved from the returned response.

										Element:pre
											{ ..., "aggs" : { "intraday_return" : { "sum" : { "script" : { "lang": "painless", "inline": "doc['change'].value" } } } } }
									Node:

											This will interpret the
										Element:code
											script
											parameter as an
										Element:code
											inline
											script with the
										Element:code
											painless
											script language and no script parameters. To use a file script use the following syntax:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ ..., "aggs" : { "intraday_return" : { "sum" : { "script" : { "file": "my_script", "params" : { "field" : "change" } } } } } }
