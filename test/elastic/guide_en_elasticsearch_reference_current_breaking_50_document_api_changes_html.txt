											The

											?refresh
											request parameter used to accept any value other than
										Element:code
											false
											,
										Element:code
											0
											,
										Element:code
											off
											, and
										Element:code
											no
											to mean "make the changes from this request visible for search immediately." Now it only accepts
										Element:code
											?refresh
											and
										Element:code
											?refresh=true
											to mean that. You can set it to
										Element:code
											?refresh=false
											and the request will take no refresh-related action. The same is true if you leave
										Element:code
											refresh
											off of the url entirely. If you add
										Element:code
											?refresh=wait_for
											Elasticsearch will wait for the changes to become visible before replying to the request but won’t take any immediate refresh related action. See
										Element:a

										Element:p
											Before 5.0.0
										Element:code
											_reindex
											and
										Element:code
											_update_by_query
											only retried bulk failures so they used the following response format:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ ... "retries": 10 ... }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Where
										Element:code
											retries
											counts the number of bulk retries. Now they retry on search failures as well and use this response format:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ ... "retries": { "bulk": 10, "search": 1 } ... }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Where
										Element:code
											bulk
											counts the number of bulk retries and
										Element:code
											search
											counts the number of search retries.

											get API
										Element:a

									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											As of 5.0.0 the get API will issue a refresh if the requested document has been changed since the last refresh but the change hasn’t been refreshed yet. This will also make all other changes visible immediately. This can have an impact on performance if the same document is updated very frequently using a read modify update pattern since it might create many small segments. This behavior can be disabled by passing
										Element:code
											realtime=false
											to the get request.
