								While

								provides
							Element:em
								Index Shard Allocation
							Element:span
								settings to control the allocation of shards to nodes, cluster-level shard allocation filtering allows you to allow or disallow the allocation of shards from
							Element:strong
								per-index
							Element:span
								index to particular nodes.
							Element:strong
								any
						Node:

								The typical use case for cluster-wide shard allocation filtering is when you want to decommission a node, and you would like to move the shards from that node to other nodes in the cluster before shutting it down.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For instance, we could decommission a node using its IP address as follows:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								PUT _cluster/settings { "transient" : { "cluster.routing.allocation.exclude._ip" : "10.0.0.1" } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:img
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Shards will only be relocated if it is possible to do so without breaking another routing constraint, such as never allocating a primary and replica shard to the same node.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2

								Cluster-wide shard allocation filtering works in the same way as index-level shard allocation filtering (see
							Element:a
								for details).

								The available
							Element:span
								cluster settings are as follows, where
							Element:em

							Element:code
								{attribute}
								refers to an arbitrary node attribute.:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:dl
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								cluster.routing.allocation.include.{attribute}
							Element:dd
								Assign the index to a node whose
							Element:code
								{attribute}
								has at least one of the comma-separated values.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								cluster.routing.allocation.require.{attribute}
							Element:dd
								Assign the index to a node whose
							Element:code
								{attribute}
								has
							Element:span
								of the comma-separated values.
							Element:em
								all
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								cluster.routing.allocation.exclude.{attribute}
							Element:dd
								Assign the index to a node whose
							Element:code

							Element:span
								of the comma-separated values.
							Element:em
