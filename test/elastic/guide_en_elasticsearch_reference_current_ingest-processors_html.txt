								All processors are defined in the following way within a pipeline definition:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "PROCESSOR_NAME" : { ... processor configuration options ... } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Each processor defines its own configuration parameters, but all processors have the ability to declare
							Element:code
								tag
								and
							Element:code
								on_failure
								fields. These fields are optional.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A
							Element:code
								tag
								is simply a string identifier of the specific instantiation of a certain processor in a pipeline. The
							Element:code
								tag
								field does not affect the processor’s behavior, but is very useful for bookkeeping and tracing errors to specific processors.

								The
							Element:a
								node info API
								can be used to figure out what processors are available in a cluster. The
							Element:a
								node info API
								will provide a per node list of what processors are available.
						Node:

								Custom processors must be installed on all nodes. The put pipeline API will fail if a processor specified in a pipeline doesn’t exist on all nodes. If you rely on custom processor plugins make sure to mark these plugins as mandatory by adding
							Element:code
								plugin.mandatory
								setting to the
							Element:code
								config/elasticsearch.yml
								file, for example:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								plugin.mandatory: ingest-attachment,ingest-geoip
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A node will not start if either of these plugins are not available.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2

								The
							Element:a
								node stats API
								can be used to fetch ingest usage statistics, globally and on a per pipeline basis. Useful to find out which pipelines are used the most or spent the most time on preprocessing.
