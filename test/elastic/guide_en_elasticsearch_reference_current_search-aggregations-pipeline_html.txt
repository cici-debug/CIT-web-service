								Pipeline aggregations work on the outputs produced from other aggregations rather than from document sets, adding information to the output tree. There are many different types of pipeline aggregation, each computing different information from other aggregations, but these types can be broken down into two families:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:dl
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:span
							Element:em
								Parent
							Element:dd
								A family of pipeline aggregations that is provided with the output of its parent aggregation and is able to compute new buckets or new aggregations to add to existing buckets.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:span
							Element:em
								Sibling
							Element:dd
								Pipeline aggregations that are provided with the output of a sibling aggregation and are able to compute a new aggregation which will be at the same level as the sibling aggregation.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Pipeline aggregations can reference the aggregations they need to perform their computation by using the
							Element:code
								buckets_path
								parameter to indicate the paths to the required metrics. The syntax for defining these paths can be found in the
							Element:a
								section below.
							Element:code
								buckets_path
								Syntax
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Pipeline aggregations cannot have sub-aggregations but depending on the type it can reference another pipeline in the
							Element:code
								buckets_path
								allowing pipeline aggregations to be chained. For example, you can chain together two derivatives to calculate the second derivative (i.e. a derivative of a derivative).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2

						Node:

								Because pipeline aggregations only add to the output, when chaining pipeline aggregations the output of each pipeline aggregation will be included in the final output.

											Most pipeline aggregations require another aggregation as their input. The input aggregation is defined via the
										Element:code
											buckets_path
											parameter, which follows a specific format:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											AGG_SEPARATOR = '>' ; METRIC_SEPARATOR = '.' ; AGG_NAME = <the name of the aggregation> ; METRIC = <the name of the metric (in case of multi-value metrics aggregation)> ; PATH = <AGG_NAME> [ <AGG_SEPARATOR>, <AGG_NAME> ]* [ <METRIC_SEPARATOR>, <METRIC> ] ;
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											For example, the path
										Element:code
											"my_bucket>my_stats.avg"
											will path to the
										Element:code
											avg
											value in the
										Element:code
											"my_stats"
											metric, which is contained in the
										Element:code
											"my_bucket"
											bucket aggregation.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Paths are relative from the position of the pipeline aggregation; they are not absolute paths, and the path cannot go back "up" the aggregation tree. For example, this moving average is embedded inside a date_histogram and refers to a "sibling" metric
										Element:code
											"the_sum"
											:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											POST /_search { "aggs": { "my_date_histo":{ "date_histogram":{ "field":"timestamp", "interval":"day" }, "aggs":{ "the_sum":{ "sum":{ "field": "lemmings" }
										Element:a
										Element:span

										Element:img

										Element:code
											"the_sum"
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td

											The
										Element:code
											buckets_path
											refers to the metric via a relative path
										Element:code
											"the_sum"
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:code
											buckets_path
											is also used for Sibling pipeline aggregations, where the aggregation is "next" to a series of buckets instead of embedded "inside" them. For example, the
										Element:code
											max_bucket
											aggregation uses the
										Element:code
											buckets_path
											to specify a metric embedded inside a sibling aggregation:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											POST /_search { "aggs" : { "sales_per_month" : { "date_histogram" : { "field" : "date", "interval" : "month" }, "aggs": { "sales": { "sum": { "field": "price" } } } }, "max_monthly_sales": { "max_bucket": { "buckets_path": "sales_per_month>sales"
										Element:a

										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img

										Element:p
										Element:code
											buckets_path
											instructs this max_bucket aggregation that we want the maximum value of the
										Element:code
											sales
											aggregation in the
										Element:code
											sales_per_month
											date histogram.

											Instead of pathing to a metric,
										Element:code
											buckets_path
											can use a special
										Element:code
											"_count"
											path. This instructs the pipeline aggregation to use the document count as it’s input. For example, a moving average can be calculated on the document count of each bucket, instead of a specific metric:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											POST /_search { "aggs": { "my_date_histo": { "date_histogram": { "field":"timestamp", "interval":"day" }, "aggs": { "the_movavg": { "moving_avg": { "buckets_path": "_count" }
										Element:a
										Element:span
											} } } } }

									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td
										Element:p
											By using
										Element:code
											_count
											instead of a metric name, we can calculate the moving average of document counts in the histogram
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											buckets_path
											can also use
										Element:code
											"_bucket_count"
											and path to a multi-bucket aggregation to use the number of buckets returned by that aggregation in the pipeline aggregation instead of a metric. for example a
										Element:code
											bucket_selector
											can be used here to filter out buckets which contain no buckets for an inner terms aggregation:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											POST /sales/_search { "size": 0, "aggs": { "histo": { "date_histogram": { "field": "date", "interval": "day" }, "aggs": { "categories": { "terms": { "field": "category" } }, "min_bucket_selector": { "bucket_selector": { "buckets_path": { "count": "categories._bucket_count"

											By using

											An alternate syntax is supported to cope with aggregations or metrics which have dots in the name, such as the

									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Data in the real world is often noisy and sometimes contains
										Element:span
											— places where data simply doesn’t exist. This can occur for a variety of reasons, the most common being:
										Element:strong
											gaps
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											Documents falling into a bucket do not contain a required field
										Element:li
											There are no documents matching the query for one or more buckets
										Element:li
											The metric being calculated is unable to generate a value, likely because another dependent bucket is missing a value. Some pipeline aggregations have specific requirements that must be met (e.g. a derivative cannot calculate a metric for the first value because there is no previous value, HoltWinters moving average need "warmup" data to begin calculating, etc)
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Gap policies are a mechanism to inform the pipeline aggregation about the desired behavior when "gappy" or missing data is encountered. All pipeline aggregations accept the
										Element:code
											gap_policy
											parameter. There are currently two gap policies to choose from:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:dl
										Element:dt
										Element:span
										Element:span
										Element:em
											skip
										Element:dd
											This option treats missing data as if the bucket does not exist. It will skip the bucket and continue calculating using the next available value.
										Element:dt
										Element:span
										Element:span
										Element:em
											insert_zeros
										Element:dd
											This option will replace missing values with a zero (
										Element:code
											0
											) and pipeline aggregation computation will proceed as normal.
