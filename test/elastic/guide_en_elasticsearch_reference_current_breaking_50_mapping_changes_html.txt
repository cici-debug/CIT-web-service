									Node:

										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											string
											field datatype has been replaced by the
										Element:code
											text
											field for full text analyzed content, and the
										Element:code
											keyword
											field for not-analyzed exact string values. For backwards compatibility purposes, during the 5.x series:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
										Element:code
											string
											fields on pre-5.0 indices will function as before.
										Element:li
											New
										Element:code
											string
											fields can be added to pre-5.0 indices as before.
										Element:li
										Element:code
											text
											and
										Element:code
											keyword
											fields can also be added to pre-5.0 indices.
										Element:li
											When adding a
										Element:code
											string
											field to a new index, the field mapping will be rewritten as a
										Element:code
											text
											or
										Element:code
											keyword
											field if possible, otherwise an exception will be thrown. Certain configurations that were possible with
										Element:code
											string
											fields are no longer possible with
										Element:code
											text
											/
										Element:code
											keyword
											fields such as enabling
										Element:code
											term_vectors
											on a not-analyzed
										Element:code
											keyword
											field.

											Default string mappings

											String mappings now have the following default mappings:
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "type": "text", "fields": { "keyword": { "type": "keyword", "ignore_above": 256 } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This allows to perform full-text search on the original field name and to sort and run aggregations on the sub keyword field.

											Numeric fields
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Numeric fields are now indexed with a completely different data-structure, called BKD tree, that is expected to require less disk space and be faster for range queries than the previous way that numerics were indexed.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Term queries will return constant scores now, while they used to return higher scores for rare terms due to the contribution of the document frequency, which this new BKD structure does not record. If scoring is needed, then it is advised to map the numeric fields as
										Element:a
											`keyword`s
											too.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Note that this
										Element:a
											mapping do not need to replace the numeric mapping. For instance if you need both sorting and scoring on your numeric field, you could map it both as a number and a
										Element:code
											keyword
										Element:code
											keyword
											using
										Element:a
											:
										Element:code
											fields

									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Also the

											precision_step

											Like Numeric fields the Geo point field now uses the new BKD tree structure. Since this structure is fundamentally designed for multi-dimension spatial data, the following field parameters are no longer needed or supported:
										Element:code
											geohash
											,
										Element:code
											geohash_prefix
											,
										Element:code
											geohash_precision
											,
										Element:code
											lat_lon
											. Geohashes are still supported from an API perspective, and can still be accessed using the
										Element:code
											.geohash
											field extension, but they are no longer used to index geo point data.

									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When dynamically mapping a field containing a floating point number, the field now defaults to using
										Element:code
											float
											instead of
										Element:code
											double
											. The reasoning is that floats should be more than enough for most cases but would decrease storage requirements significantly.

											To prevent mapping explosions, the following limits are applied to indices created in 5.x:
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											The maximum number of fields in an index is limited to 1000.
										Element:li
											The maximum depth for a field (1 plus the number of
										Element:code
											object
											or
										Element:code
											nested
											parents) is limited to 20.
										Element:li
											The maximum number of
										Element:code
											nested
											fields in an index is limited to 50.
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The join between parent and child documents no longer relies on indexed fields and therefore from 5.0.0 onwards the
										Element:code
											_parent
											field is no longer indexed. In order to find documents that refer to a specific parent id, the new
										Element:code
											parent_id
											query can be used. The GET response and hits inside the search response still include the parent id under the
										Element:code
											_parent
											key.

											Per-field boosts on the

											You can no longer create indexes with
										Element:code
											_ttl
											or
										Element:code
											_timestamp
											enabled. Indexes with them enabled created before 5.0 will continue to work.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You should replace
										Element:code
											_timestamp
											in new indexes by adding a field to your source either in the application producing the data or with an ingest pipline like this one:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											PUT _ingest/pipeline/timestamp { "description" : "Adds a timestamp field at the current time", "processors" : [ { "set" : { "field": "timestamp", "value": "{{_ingest.timestamp}}" } } ] } PUT newindex/type/1?pipeline=timestamp { "example": "data" } GET newindex/type/1
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Which produces
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "_source": { "example": "data", "timestamp": "2016-06-21T18:48:55.560+0000" }, ... }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you have an old index created with 2.x that has
										Element:code
											_timestamp
											enabled then you can migrate it to a new index with the a
										Element:code
											timestamp
											field in the source with reindex:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											POST _reindex { "source": { "index": "oldindex" }, "dest": { "index": "newindex" }, "script": { "lang": "painless", "inline": "ctx._source.timestamp = ctx._timestamp; ctx._timestamp = null" } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You can replace
										Element:code
											_ttl
											with time based index names (preferred) or by adding a cron job which runs a delete-by-query on a timestamp field in the source document. If you had documents like this:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											POST index/type/_bulk {"index":{"_id":1}} {"example": "data", "timestamp": "2016-06-21T18:48:55.560+0000" } {"index":{"_id":2}} {"example": "data", "timestamp": "2016-04-21T18:48:55.560+0000" }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Then you could delete all of the documents from before June 1st with:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											POST index/type/_delete_by_query { "query": { "range" : { "timestamp" : { "lt" : "2016-05-01" } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Keep in mind that deleting documents from an index is very expensive compared to deleting whole indexes. That is why time based indexes are recommended over this sort of thing and why
										Element:code
											_ttl
											was deprecated in the first place.
