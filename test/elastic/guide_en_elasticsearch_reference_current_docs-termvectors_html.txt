											The term and field statistics are not accurate. Deleted documents are not taken into account. The information is only retrieved for the shard the requested document resides in. The term and field statistics are therefore only useful as relative measures whereas the absolute numbers have no meaning in this context. By default, when requesting term vectors of artificial documents, a shard to get the statistics from is randomly selected. Use
										Element:code
											routing
											only to hit a particular shard.

											Example 1. Returning stored term vectors
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											First, we create an index that stores term vectors, payloads etc. :
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											curl -s -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/' -d '{ "mappings": { "tweet": { "properties": { "text": { "type": "text", "term_vector": "with_positions_offsets_payloads", "store" : true, "analyzer" : "fulltext_analyzer" }, "fullname": { "type": "text", "term_vector": "with_positions_offsets_payloads", "analyzer" : "fulltext_analyzer" } } } }, "settings" : { "index" : { "number_of_shards" : 1, "number_of_replicas" : 0 }, "analysis": { "analyzer": { "fulltext_analyzer": { "type": "custom", "tokenizer": "whitespace", "filter": [ "lowercase", "type_as_payload" ] } } } } }'
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Second, we add some documents:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1?pretty=true' -d '{ "fullname" : "John Doe", "text" : "twitter test test test " }' curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/2?pretty=true' -d '{ "fullname" : "Jane Doe", "text" : "Another twitter test ..." }'
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The following request returns all information and statistics for field
										Element:code
											text
											in document
										Element:code
											1
											(John Doe):
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1/_termvectors?pretty=true' -d '{ "fields" : ["text"], "offsets" : true, "payloads" : true, "positions" : true, "term_statistics" : true, "field_statistics" : true }'
									Node:

											Example 2. Generating term vectors on the fly
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Term vectors which are not explicitly stored in the index are automatically computed on the fly. The following request returns all information and statistics for the fields in document
										Element:code
											1
											, even though the terms haven’t been explicitly stored in the index. Note that for the field
										Element:code
											text
											, the terms are not re-generated.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1/_termvectors?pretty=true' -d '{ "fields" : ["text", "some_field_without_term_vectors"], "offsets" : true, "positions" : true, "term_statistics" : true, "field_statistics" : true }'
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:br
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:a
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											Example 3. Artificial documents
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Term vectors can also be generated for artificial documents, that is for documents not present in the index. For example, the following request would return the same results as in example 1. The mapping used is determined by the
										Element:code
											index
											and
										Element:code
											type
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:span
										Element:strong
											If dynamic mapping is turned on (default), the document fields not in the original mapping will be dynamically created.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/_termvectors' -d '{ "doc" : { "fullname" : "John Doe", "text" : "twitter test test test" } }'

											Example 4. Per-field analyzer
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Additionally, a different analyzer than the one at the field may be provided by using the
										Element:code
											per_field_analyzer
											parameter. This is useful in order to generate term vectors in any fashion, especially when using artificial documents. When providing an analyzer for a field that already stores term vectors, the term vectors will be re-generated.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/_termvectors' -d '{ "doc" : { "fullname" : "John Doe", "text" : "twitter test test test" }, "fields": ["fullname"], "per_field_analyzer" : { "fullname": "keyword" } }'

											Example 5. Terms filtering
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Finally, the terms returned could be filtered based on their tf-idf scores. In the example below we obtain the three most "interesting" keywords from the artificial document having the given "plot" field value. Notice that the keyword "Tony" or any stop words are not part of the response, as their tf-idf must be too low.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET /imdb/movies/_termvectors { "doc": { "plot": "When wealthy industrialist Tony Stark is forced to build an armored suit after a life-threatening incident, he ultimately decides to use its technology to fight against evil." }, "term_statistics" : true, "field_statistics" : true, "positions": false, "offsets": false, "filter" : { "max_num_terms" : 3, "min_term_freq" : 1, "min_doc_freq" : 1 } }
