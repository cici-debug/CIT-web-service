											On Linux systems,
										Element:code
											ulimit
											can be used to change resource limits on a temporary basis. Limits usually need to be set as
										Element:code
											root
											before switching to the user that will run Elasticsearch. For example, to set the number of open file handles (
										Element:code
											ulimit -n
											) to 65,536, you can do the following:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre

											On Linux systems, persistent limits can be set for a particular user by editing the

											/etc/security/limits.conf
											file. To set the maximum number of open files for the

									Node:

											The systemd service file (

									Node:

											The preferred method of setting Java Virtual Machine options (including system properties and JVM flags) is via the
										Element:code
											jvm.options
											configuration file. The default location of this file is
										Element:code
											config/jvm.options
											(when installing from the tar or zip distributions) and
										Element:code
											/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options
											(when installing from the Debian or RPM packages). This file contains a line-delimited list of JVM arguments, which must begin with
										Element:code
											-
											. You can add custom JVM flags to this file and check this configuration into your version control system.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											An alternative mechanism for setting Java Virtual Machine options is via the
										Element:code
											ES_JAVA_OPTS
											environment variable. For instance:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											export ES_JAVA_OPTS="$ES_JAVA_OPTS -Djava.io.tmpdir=/path/to/temp/dir" ./bin/elasticsearch
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When using the RPM or Debian packages,
										Element:code
											ES_JAVA_OPTS
											can be specified in the
										Element:a
											system configuration file
											.
