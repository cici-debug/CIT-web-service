								The discovery module is responsible for discovering nodes within a cluster, as well as electing a master node.
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								Note, Elasticsearch is a peer to peer based system, nodes communicate with one another directly if operations are delegated / broadcast. All the main APIs (index, delete, search) do not communicate with the master node. The responsibility of the master node is to maintain the global cluster state, and act if nodes join or leave the cluster by reassigning shards. Each time a cluster state is changed, the state is made known to the other nodes in the cluster (the manner depends on the actual discovery implementation).

											The

											cluster.name
											allows to create separated clusters from one another. The default value for the cluster name is
										Element:code
											elasticsearch
											, though it is recommended to change this to reflect the logical group name of the cluster running.
