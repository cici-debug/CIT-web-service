											Plugins with custom query implementations
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Plugins implementing custom queries need to implement the
										Element:code
											fromXContent(QueryParseContext)
											method in their
										Element:code
											QueryParser
											subclass rather than
										Element:code
											parse
											. This method will take care of parsing the query from
										Element:code
											XContent
											format into an intermediate query representation that can be streamed between the nodes in binary format, effectively the query object used in the java api. Also, the query builder needs to be registered as a
										Element:code
											NamedWriteable
											. This is all done by implementing the
										Element:code
											SearchPlugin
											interface and overriding the
										Element:code
											getQueries
											method. The query object can then transform itself into a lucene query through the new
										Element:code
											toQuery(QueryShardContext)
											method, which returns a lucene query to be executed on the data node.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Similarly, plugins implementing custom score functions need to implement the
										Element:code
											fromXContent(QueryParseContext)
											method in their
										Element:code
											ScoreFunctionParser
											subclass rather than
										Element:code
											parse
											. This method will take care of parsing the function from
										Element:code
											XContent
											format into an intermediate function representation that can be streamed between the nodes in binary format, effectively the function object used in the java api. The function object can then transform itself into a lucene function through the new
										Element:code
											toFunction(QueryShardContext)
											method, which returns a lucene function to be executed on the data node.

											The

											ext
											element. Plugins can plug in custom parsers for those additional sections by providing a
										Element:code
											SearchPlugin.SearchExtSpec
											, which consists of a
										Element:code
											SearchExtParser
											implementation that can parse`XContent` into a
										Element:code
											SearchExtBuilder
											implementation. The parsing happens now in the coordinating node. The result of parsing is serialized to the data nodes through transport layer together with the rest of the search request and stored in the search context for later retrieval.
