								Most fields are
							Element:a
								indexed
								by default, which makes them searchable. The inverted index allows queries to look up the search term in unique sorted list of terms, and from that immediately have access to the list of documents that contain the term.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Sorting, aggregations, and access to field values in scripts requires a different data access pattern. Instead of looking up the term and finding documents, we need to be able to look up the document and find the terms that it has in a field.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Doc values are the on-disk data structure, built at document index time, which makes this data access pattern possible. They store the same values as the
							Element:code
								_source
								but in a column-oriented fashion that is way more efficient for sorting and aggregations. Doc values are supported on almost all field types, with the
							Element:span
								.
							Element:em
								notable exception of
							Element:code
								analyzed
								string fields
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								All fields which support doc values have them enabled by default. If you are sure that you don’t need to sort or aggregate on a field, or access the field value from a script, you can disable doc values in order to save disk space:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								PUT my_index { "mappings": { "my_type": { "properties": { "status_code": {
							Element:a
							Element:span
