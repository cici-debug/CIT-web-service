										Element:p
											A
										Element:span
											receives the original text as a stream of characters and can transform the stream by adding, removing, or changing characters. For instance, a character filter could be used to convert Hindu-Arabic numerals (٠‎١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨‎٩‎) into their Arabic-Latin equivalents (0123456789), or to strip HTML elements like
										Element:em
											character filter
										Element:code
											<b>
											from the stream.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											An analyzer may have
										Element:span
										Element:strong
											zero or more
										Element:a
											character filters
											, which are applied in order.

										Element:a

									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											A
										Element:span
											receives a stream of characters, breaks it up into individual
										Element:em
											tokenizer
										Element:span
											(usually individual words), and outputs a stream of
										Element:em
											tokens
										Element:span
											. For instance, a
										Element:em
											tokens
										Element:a
											tokenizer breaks text into tokens whenever it sees any whitespace. It would convert the text
										Element:code
											whitespace
										Element:code
											"Quick brown fox!"
											into the terms
										Element:code
											[Quick, brown, fox!]
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The tokenizer is also responsible for recording the order or
										Element:span
											of each term and the start and end
										Element:em
											position
										Element:span
											of the original word which the term represents.
										Element:em

											token filter
										Element:a
											token filter converts all tokens to lowercase, a

											token filter removes common words (
