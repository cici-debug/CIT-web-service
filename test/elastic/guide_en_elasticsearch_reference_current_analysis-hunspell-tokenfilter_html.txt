								Basic support for hunspell stemming. Hunspell dictionaries will be picked up from a dedicated hunspell directory on the filesystem (
							Element:code
								<path.conf>/hunspell
								). Each dictionary is expected to have its own directory named after its associated locale (language). This dictionary directory is expected to hold a single
							Element:code
								*.aff
								and one or more
							Element:code
								*.dic
								files (all of which will automatically be picked up). For example, assuming the default hunspell location is used, the following directory layout will define the
							Element:code
								en_US
								dictionary:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								- conf |-- hunspell | |-- en_US | | |-- en_US.dic | | |-- en_US.aff
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Each dictionary can be configured with one setting:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:dl
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								ignore_case
							Element:dd
								If true, dictionary matching will be case insensitive (defaults to
							Element:code
								false
								)
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This setting can be configured globally in
							Element:code
								elasticsearch.yml
								using
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:code
								indices.analysis.hunspell.dictionary.ignore_case
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								or for specific dictionaries:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:code
								indices.analysis.hunspell.dictionary.en_US.ignore_case
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								It is also possible to add
							Element:code
								settings.yml
								file under the dictionary directory which holds these settings (this will override any other settings defined in the
							Element:code
								elasticsearch.yml
								).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								One can use the hunspell stem filter by configuring it the analysis settings:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "analysis" : { "analyzer" : { "en" : { "tokenizer" : "standard", "filter" : [ "lowercase", "en_US" ] } }, "filter" : { "en_US" : { "type" : "hunspell", "locale" : "en_US", "dedup" : true } } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The hunspell token filter accepts four options:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:dl
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								locale
							Element:dd
								A locale for this filter. If this is unset, the
							Element:code
								lang
								or
							Element:code
								language
								are used instead - so one of these has to be set.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								dictionary
							Element:dd
								The name of a dictionary. The path to your hunspell dictionaries should be configured via
							Element:code
								indices.analysis.hunspell.dictionary.location
								before.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								dedup
							Element:dd
								If only unique terms should be returned, this needs to be set to
							Element:code
								true
								. Defaults to
							Element:code
								true
								.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								longest_only
							Element:dd
								If only the longest term should be returned, set this to
							Element:code
								true
								. Defaults to
							Element:code
								false
								: all possible stems are returned.

								As opposed to the snowball stemmers (which are algorithm based) this is a dictionary lookup based stemmer and therefore the quality of the stemming is determined by the quality of the dictionary.
