								The completion suggester has undergone a complete rewrite. This means that the syntax and data structure for fields of type
							Element:code
								completion
								have changed, as have the syntax and response of completion suggester requests. See
							Element:a
								completion suggester
								for details.
						Node:

							Element:p
								For indices created before Elasticsearch 5.0.0,
							Element:code
								completion
								fields and the completion suggester will continue to work as they did in Elasticsearch 2.x. However, it is not possible to run a completion suggester query across indices created in 2.x and indices created in 5.x.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								It is strongly recommended to reindex indices containing 2.x
							Element:code
								completion
								fields in 5.x to take advantage of the new features listed below.

											Previously, deleted suggestions could be included in results even after refreshing an index. Now, deletions are visible in near-real time, i.e. as soon as the index has been refreshed. This applies to suggestion entries for both context and completion suggesters.

											Suggestions are aware of the document they belong to. Now, associated documents (

											) are returned as part of
										Element:code
											completion
											suggestions.

											Previously,

											and

											suggesters supported an index-time
										Element:code

											option, which was used to store and return metadata with suggestions. Now metadata can be stored as part of the the same document as the suggestion for retrieval at query-time. The support for index-time
										Element:code
											payloads
											has been removed to avoid bloating the in-memory index with suggestion metadata.

										Element:p
											As suggestions are document-oriented, suggestion metadata (e.g.
										Element:code
											output
											) should now be specified as a field in the document. The support for specifying
										Element:code
											output
											when indexing suggestion entries has been removed. Now suggestion result entry’s
										Element:code
											text
											is always the un-analyzed value of the suggestion’s
										Element:code
											input
											(same as not specifying
										Element:code
											output
											while indexing suggestions in pre-5.0 indices).

											Completion mapping with multiple contexts

									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											context
											option in
										Element:code
											completion
											field mapping is now an array to support multiple named contexts per completion field. Note that this is sugar for indexing same suggestions under different name with different contexts. The
										Element:code
											default
											option for a named
										Element:code
											context
											has been removed. Now querying with no
										Element:code
											context
											against a context-enabled completion field yields results from all indexed suggestions. Note that performance for match-all-context query degrades with the number of unique context value for a given
										Element:code
											completion
											field.

										Element:p
											Previously
										Element:code
											context
											option in a suggest request was used for filtering suggestions by
										Element:code
											context
											value. Now, the option has been named to
										Element:code
											contexts
											to specify multiple named context filters. Note that this is not supported by pre-5.0 indices. Following is the
