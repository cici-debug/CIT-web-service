							Element:p
								A parent pipeline aggregation which executes a script which determines whether the current bucket will be retained in the parent multi-bucket aggregation. The specified metric must be numeric and the script must return a boolean value. If the script language is
							Element:code
								expression
								then a numeric return value is permitted. In this case 0.0 will be evaluated as
							Element:code
								false
								and all other values will evaluate to true.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Note: The bucket_selector aggregation, like all pipeline aggregations, executions after all other sibling aggregations. This means that using the bucket_selector aggregation to filter the returned buckets in the response does not save on execution time running the aggregations.
