								The search request can be executed with a search DSL, which includes the
							Element:a
								Query DSL
								, within its body. Here is an example:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET /twitter/tweet/_search { "query" : { "term" : { "user" : "kimchy" } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								And here is a sample response:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "took": 1, "timed_out": false, "_shards":{ "total" : 1, "successful" : 1, "failed" : 0 }, "hits":{ "total" : 1, "max_score": 1.3862944, "hits" : [ { "_index" : "twitter", "_type" : "tweet", "_id" : "0", "_score": 1.3862944, "_source" : { "user" : "kimchy", "message": "trying out Elasticsearch", "date" : "2009-11-15T14:12:12", "likes" : 0 } } ] } }

											timeout
										Element:td
										Element:p
											A search timeout, bounding the search request to be executed within the specified time value and bail with the hits accumulated up to that point when expired. Defaults to no timeout. See
										Element:a
											the section called “Time units
										Element:a
											edit
											”.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											from
										Element:td

											0
											.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											size
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The number of hits to return. Defaults to
										Element:code
											10
											. If you do not care about getting some hits back but only about the number of matches and/or aggregations, setting the value to
										Element:code
											0
											will help performance.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											search_type
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The type of the search operation to perform. Can be
										Element:code
											dfs_query_then_fetch
											or
										Element:code
											query_then_fetch
											. Defaults to
										Element:code
											query_then_fetch

										Element:td
										Element:p
											Set to

											or
										Element:code
											false
											to enable or disable the caching of search results for requests where
										Element:code
											size
											is 0, ie aggregations and suggestions (no top hits returned). See
										Element:a
											Shard request cache
											.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											terminate_after
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The maximum number of documents to collect for each shard, upon reaching which the query execution will terminate early. If set, the response will have a boolean field
										Element:code
											terminated_early
											to indicate whether the query execution has actually terminated_early. Defaults to no terminate_after.
									Node:

										Element:p
											Out of the above, the
										Element:code
											search_type
											and the
										Element:code
											request_cache
											must be passed as query-string parameters. The rest of the search request should be passed within the body itself. The body content can also be passed as a REST parameter named
										Element:code
											source
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Both HTTP GET and HTTP POST can be used to execute search with body. Since not all clients support GET with body, POST is allowed as well.

										Element:p
											In case we only want to know if there are any documents matching a specific query, we can set the
										Element:code
											size
											to
										Element:code
											0
											to indicate that we are not interested in the search results. Also we can set
										Element:code
											terminate_after
											to
										Element:code
											1
											to indicate that the query execution can be terminated whenever the first matching document was found (per shard).
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET /_search?q=message:elasticsearch&size=0&terminate_after=1
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The response will not contain any hits as the
										Element:code
											size
											was set to
										Element:code
											0
											. The
										Element:code
											hits.total
											will be either equal to
										Element:code
											0
											, indicating that there were no matching documents, or greater than
										Element:code
											0
											meaning that there were at least as many documents matching the query when it was early terminated. Also if the query was terminated early, the
										Element:code
											terminated_early
											flag will be set to
										Element:code
											true
											in the response.
