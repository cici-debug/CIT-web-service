								The processors in a pipeline have read and write access to documents that pass through the pipeline. The processors can access fields in the source of a document and the document’s metadata fields.

											Accessing Fields in the Source
										Element:a

									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Accessing a field in the source is straightforward. You simply refer to fields by their name. For example:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "set": { "field": "my_field" "value": 582.1 } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											On top of this, fields from the source are always accessible via the
										Element:code
											_source
											prefix:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "set": { "field": "_source.my_field" "value": 582.1 } }

											Accessing Metadata Fields
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You can access metadata fields in the same way that you access fields in the source. This is possible because Elasticsearch doesn’t allow fields in the source that have the same name as metadata fields.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The following example sets the
										Element:code
											_id
											metadata field of a document to
										Element:code
											1
											:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "set": { "field": "_id" "value": "1" } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The following metadata fields are accessible by a processor:
										Element:code
											_index
											,
										Element:code
											_type
											,
										Element:code
											_id
											,
										Element:code
											_routing
											,
										Element:code
											_parent
											.

											Accessing Ingest Metadata Fields
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Beyond metadata fields and source fields, ingest also adds ingest metadata to the documents that it processes. These metadata properties are accessible under the
										Element:code
											_ingest
											key. Currently ingest adds the ingest timestamp under the
										Element:code
											_ingest.timestamp
											key of the ingest metadata. The ingest timestamp is the time when Elasticsearch received the index or bulk request to pre-process the document.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Any processor can add ingest-related metadata during document processing. Ingest metadata is transient and is lost after a document has been processed by the pipeline. Therefore, ingest metadata won’t be indexed.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The following example adds a field with the name
										Element:code
											received
											. The value is the ingest timestamp:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "set": { "field": "received" "value": "{{_ingest.timestamp}}" } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Unlike Elasticsearch metadata fields, the ingest metadata field name
										Element:code
											_ingest
											can be used as a valid field name in the source of a document. Use
										Element:code
											_source._ingest
											to refer to the field in the source document. Otherwise,
										Element:code
											_ingest
											will be interpreted as an ingest metadata field.

											Accessing Fields and Metafields in Templates
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											A number of processor settings also support templating. Settings that support templating can have zero or more template snippets. A template snippet begins with
										Element:code
											{{
											and ends with
										Element:code
											}}
											. Accessing fields and metafields in templates is exactly the same as via regular processor field settings.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The following example adds a field named
										Element:code
											field_c
											. Its value is a concatenation of the values of
										Element:code
											field_a
											and
										Element:code
											field_b
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "set": { "field": "field_c" "value": "{{field_a}} {{field_b}}" } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The following example uses the value of the
										Element:code
											geoip.country_iso_code
											field in the source to set the index that the document will be indexed into:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "set": { "field": "_index" "value": "{{geoip.country_iso_code}}" } }
