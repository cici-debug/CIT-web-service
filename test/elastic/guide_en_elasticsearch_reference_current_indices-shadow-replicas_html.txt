											Deprecated in 5.2.0.
											Shadow replicas don’t see much usage and we are planning to remove them
									Node:

											If you would like to use a shared filesystem, you can use the shadow replicas settings to choose where on disk the data for an index should be kept, as well as how Elasticsearch should replay operations on all the replica shards of an index.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In order to fully utilize the
										Element:code
											index.data_path
											and
										Element:code
											index.shadow_replicas
											settings, you need to allow Elasticsearch to use the same data directory for multiple instances by setting
										Element:code
											node.add_lock_id_to_custom_path
											to false in elasticsearch.yml:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											node.add_lock_id_to_custom_path: false
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You will also need to indicate to the security manager where the custom indices will be, so that the correct permissions can be applied. You can do this by setting the
										Element:code
											path.shared_data
											setting in elasticsearch.yml:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											path.shared_data: /opt/data
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This means that Elasticsearch can read and write to files in any subdirectory of the
										Element:code
											path.shared_data
											setting.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You can then create an index with a custom data path, where each node will use this path for the data:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Because shadow replicas do not index the document on replica shards, it’s possible for the replica’s known mapping to be behind the index’s known mapping if the latest cluster state has not yet been processed on the node containing the replica. Because of this, it is highly recommended to use pre-defined mappings when using shadow replicas.
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:pre
											curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/my_index' -d ' { "index" : { "number_of_shards" : 1, "number_of_replicas" : 4, "data_path": "/opt/data/my_index", "shadow_replicas": true } }'
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In the above example, the "/opt/data/my_index" path is a shared filesystem that must be available on every node in the Elasticsearch cluster. You must also ensure that the Elasticsearch process has the correct permissions to read from and write to the directory used in the
										Element:code
											index.data_path
											setting.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											data_path
											does not have to contain the index name, in this case, "my_index" was used but it could easily also have been "/opt/data/"
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											An index that has been created with the
										Element:code
											index.shadow_replicas
											setting set to "true" will not replicate document operations to any of the replica shards, instead, it will only continually refresh. Once segments are available on the filesystem where the shadow replica resides (after an Elasticsearch "flush"), a regular refresh (governed by the
										Element:code
											index.refresh_interval
											) can be used to make the new data searchable.
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:img
									Node:

										Element:p
											Since documents are only indexed on the primary shard, realtime GET requests could fail to return a document if executed on the replica shard, therefore, GET API requests automatically have the
										Element:code
											?preference=_primary
											flag set if there is no preference flag already set.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In order to ensure the data is being synchronized in a fast enough manner, you may need to tune the flush threshold for the index to a desired number. A flush is needed to fsync segment files to disk, so they will be visible to all other replica nodes. Users should test what flush threshold levels they are comfortable with, as increased flushing can impact indexing performance.
									Node:

										Element:p
											The Elasticsearch cluster will still detect the loss of a primary shard, and transform the replica into a primary in this situation. This transformation will take slightly longer, since no
										Element:code
											IndexWriter
											is maintained for each shadow replica.

									(type) c

											Below is the list of settings that can be changed using the update settings API:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:dl
										Element:dt
										Element:span
										Element:code
											index.data_path
											(string)
										Element:dd
											Path to use for the index’s data. Note that by default Elasticsearch will append the node ordinal by default to the path to ensure multiple instances of Elasticsearch on the same machine do not share a data directory.
										Element:dt
										Element:span
										Element:code
											index.shadow_replicas
										Element:dd
											Boolean value indicating this index should use shadow replicas. Defaults to
										Element:code
											false
											.
										Element:dt
										Element:span
										Element:code
											index.shared_filesystem
										Element:dd
											Boolean value indicating this index uses a shared filesystem. Defaults to the
										Element:code
											true
											if
										Element:code
											index.shadow_replicas
											is set to true,
										Element:code
											false
											otherwise.
										Element:dt
										Element:span
										Element:code
											index.shared_filesystem.recover_on_any_node
										Element:dd
											Boolean value indicating whether the primary shards for the index should be allowed to recover on any node in the cluster. If a node holding a copy of the shard is found, recovery prefers that node. Defaults to
										Element:code
											false
											.
