						Node:

								Unallocated shards are recovered in order of priority, whenever possible. Indices are sorted into priority order as follows:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								the optional
							Element:code
								index.priority
								setting (higher before lower)
							Element:li
								the index creation date (higher before lower)
							Element:li
								the index name (higher before lower)
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This means that, by default, newer indices will be recovered before older indices.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Use the per-index dynamically updateable
							Element:code
								index.priority
								setting to customise the index prioritization order. For instance:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								PUT index_1 PUT index_2 PUT index_3 { "settings": { "index.priority": 10 } } PUT index_4 { "settings": { "index.priority": 5 } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In the above example:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:code
								index_3
								will be recovered first because it has the highest
							Element:code
								index.priority
								.
							Element:li
							Element:code
								index_4
								will be recovered next because it has the next highest priority.
							Element:li
							Element:code
								index_2
								will be recovered next because it was created more recently.
							Element:li
							Element:code
								index_1
								will be recovered last.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This setting accepts an integer, and can be updated on a live index with the
							Element:a
								update index settings API
								:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								PUT index_4/_settings { "index.priority": 1 }
