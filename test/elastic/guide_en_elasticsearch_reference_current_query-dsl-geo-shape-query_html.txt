								Mapping
						Node:

							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								geo_shape
								query uses the same grid square representation as the geo_shape mapping to find documents that have a shape that intersects with the query shape. It will also use the same PrefixTree configuration as defined for the field mapping.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The query supports two ways of defining the query shape, either by providing a whole shape definition, or by referencing the name of a shape pre-indexed in another index. Both formats are defined below with examples.

											Similar to the
										Element:code
											geo_shape
											type, the
										Element:code
											geo_shape
											Filter uses
										Element:a
											GeoJSON
											to represent shapes.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Given a document that looks like this:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "name": "Wind & Wetter, Berlin, Germany", "location": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [13.400544, 52.530286] } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The following query will find the point using the Elasticsearch’s
										Element:code
											envelope
											GeoJSON extension:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET /_search { "query":{ "bool": { "must": { "match_all": {} }, "filter": { "geo_shape": { "location": { "shape": { "type": "envelope", "coordinates" : [[13.0, 53.0], [14.0, 52.0]] }, "relation": "within" } } } } } }

											Pre-Indexed Shape

									Node:

										Element:p
											The Query also supports using a shape which has already been indexed in another index and/or index type. This is particularly useful for when you have a pre-defined list of shapes which are useful to your application and you want to reference this using a logical name (for example
										Element:span
											) rather than having to provide their coordinates each time. In this situation it is only necessary to provide:
										Element:em

									Node:

										Element:ul
										Element:li
										Element:code
											id
											- The ID of the document that containing the pre-indexed shape.
										Element:li
										Element:code
											index
											- Name of the index where the pre-indexed shape is. Defaults to
										Element:span
											.
										Element:em
											shapes
										Element:li
										Element:code
											type
											- Index type where the pre-indexed shape is.
										Element:li
										Element:code
											path
											- The field specified as path containing the pre-indexed shape. Defaults to
										Element:span
											.
										Element:em
											shape
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The following is an example of using the Filter with a pre-indexed shape:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET /_search { "query": { "bool": { "must": { "match_all": {} }, "filter": { "geo_shape": { "location": { "indexed_shape": { "id": "DEU", "type": "countries", "index": "shapes", "path": "location" } } } } } } }

											- (default) Return all documents whose

											- Return all documents whose
										Element:code
											geo_shape
											field has nothing in common with the query geometry.
										Element:li
										Element:code
											WITHIN
											- Return all documents whose
										Element:code
											geo_shape
											field is within the query geometry.
										Element:li
										Element:code
											CONTAINS
											- Return all documents whose
