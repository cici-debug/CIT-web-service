								The get pipeline API returns pipelines based on ID. This API always returns a local reference of the pipeline.
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:pre
								GET _ingest/pipeline/my-pipeline-id
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Example response:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "my-pipeline-id" : { "description" : "describe pipeline", "processors" : [ { "set" : { "field" : "foo", "value" : "bar" } } ] } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For each returned pipeline, the source and the version are returned. The version is useful for knowing which version of the pipeline the node has. You can specify multiple IDs to return more than one pipeline. Wildcards are also supported.

														Pipelines can optionally add a
													Element:code
														version
														number, which can be any integer value, in order to simplify pipeline management by external systems. The
													Element:code
														version
														field is completely optional and it is meant solely for external management of pipelines. To unset a
													Element:code
														version
														, simply replace the pipeline without specifying one.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														PUT _ingest/pipeline/my-pipeline-id { "description" : "describe pipeline", "version" : 123, "processors" : [ { "set" : { "field": "foo", "value": "bar" } } ] }
												Node:
												(type) c

													Element:p
														To check for the
													Element:code
														version
														, you can
													Element:a
														filter responses
														using
													Element:code
														filter_path
														to limit the response to just the
													Element:code
														version
														:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														GET /_ingest/pipeline/my-pipeline-id?filter_path=*.version
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														This should give a small response that makes it both easy and inexpensive to parse:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														{ "my-pipeline-id" : { "version" : 123 } }
