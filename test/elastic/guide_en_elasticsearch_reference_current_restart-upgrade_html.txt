								Elasticsearch requires a full cluster restart when upgrading across major versions. Rolling upgrades are not supported across major versions. Consult this
							Element:a
								table
								to verify that a full cluster restart is required.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The process to perform an upgrade with a full cluster restart is as follows:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
							Element:p
							Element:span
							Element:strong
								Disable shard allocation
							Element:p
								When you shut down a node, the allocation process will immediately try to replicate the shards that were on that node to other nodes in the cluster, causing a lot of wasted I/O. This can be avoided by disabling allocation before shutting down a node:
							Element:pre
								PUT _cluster/settings { "persistent": { "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "none" } }
							Element:li
							Element:p
							Element:span
							Element:strong
								Perform a synced flush
							Element:p
								Shard recovery will be much faster if you stop indexing and issue a
							Element:a
								synced-flush
								request:
							Element:pre
								POST _flush/synced
							Element:p
								A synced flush request is a “best effort” operation. It will fail if there are any pending indexing operations, but it is safe to reissue the request multiple times if necessary.
							Element:li
							Element:p
							Element:span
							Element:strong
								Shutdown and upgrade all nodes
							Element:p
								Stop all Elasticsearch services on all nodes in the cluster. Each node can be upgraded following the same procedure described in
							Element:a
								[upgrade-node]
								.
							Element:li
							Element:p
							Element:span
							Element:strong
								Upgrade any plugins
							Element:p
								Elasticsearch plugins must be upgraded when upgrading a node. Use the
							Element:code
								elasticsearch-plugin
								script to install the correct version of any plugins that you need.
							Element:li
							Element:p
							Element:span
							Element:strong
								Start the cluster
							Element:p
								If you have dedicated master nodes — nodes with
							Element:code
								node.master
								set to
							Element:code
								true
								(the default) and
							Element:code
								node.data
								set to
							Element:code
								false
								— then it is a good idea to start them first. Wait for them to form a cluster and to elect a master before proceeding with the data nodes. You can check progress by looking at the logs.
							Element:p
								As soon as the
							Element:a
								minimum number of master-eligible nodes
								have discovered each other, they will form a cluster and elect a master. From that point on, the
							Element:a
								and
							Element:code
								_cat/health
							Element:a
								APIs can be used to monitor nodes joining the cluster:
							Element:code
								_cat/nodes
							Element:pre
								GET _cat/health GET _cat/nodes
							Element:p
								Use these APIs to check that all nodes have successfully joined the cluster.
							Element:li
							Element:p
							Element:span
							Element:strong
								Wait for yellow
							Element:p
								As soon as each node has joined the cluster, it will start to recover any primary shards that are stored locally. Initially, the
							Element:a
								request will report a
							Element:code
								_cat/health
							Element:code
								status
								of
							Element:code
								red
								, meaning that not all primary shards have been allocated.
							Element:p
								Once each node has recovered its local shards, the
							Element:code
								status
								will become
							Element:code
								yellow
								, meaning all primary shards have been recovered, but not all replica shards are allocated. This is to be expected because allocation is still disabled.
							Element:li
							Element:p
							Element:span
							Element:strong
								Reenable allocation
							Element:p
								Delaying the allocation of replicas until all nodes have joined the cluster allows the master to allocate replicas to nodes which already have local shard copies. At this point, with all the nodes in the cluster, it is safe to reenable shard allocation:
							Element:pre
								PUT _cluster/settings { "persistent": { "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "all" } }
							Element:p
								The cluster will now start allocating replica shards to all data nodes. At this point it is safe to resume indexing and searching, but your cluster will recover more quickly if you can delay indexing and searching until all shards have recovered.
							Element:p
								You can monitor progress with the
							Element:a
								and
							Element:code
								_cat/health
							Element:a
								APIs:
							Element:code
								_cat/recovery
							Element:pre
								GET _cat/health GET _cat/recovery
							Element:p
								Once the
							Element:code
								status
								column in the
							Element:code
								_cat/health
								output has reached
							Element:code
								green
								, all primary and replica shards have been successfully allocated.
