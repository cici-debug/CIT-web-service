								Span Field Masking Query
							Element:a
								edit
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Wrapper to allow span queries to participate in composite single-field span queries by
							Element:span
								about their search field. The span field masking query maps to Lucene’s
							Element:em
								lying
							Element:code
								SpanFieldMaskingQuery
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This can be used to support queries like
							Element:code
								span-near
								or
							Element:code
								span-or
								across different fields, which is not ordinarily permitted.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Span field masking query is invaluable in conjunction with
							Element:span
								when same content is indexed with multiple analyzers. For instance we could index a field with the standard analyzer which breaks text up into words, and again with the english analyzer which stems words into their root form.
							Element:strong
								multi-fields
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Example:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET /_search { "query": { "span_near": { "clauses": [ { "span_term": { "text": "quick brown" } }, { "field_masking_span": { "query": { "span_term": { "text.stems": "fox" } }, "field": "text" } } ], "slop": 5, "in_order": false } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Note: as span field masking query returns the masked field, scoring will be done using the norms of the field name supplied. This may lead to unexpected scoring behaviour.
