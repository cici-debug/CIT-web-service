								Open / Close Index API

						Node:

							Element:p
								The open and close index APIs allow to close an index, and later on opening it. A closed index has almost no overhead on the cluster (except for maintaining its metadata), and is blocked for read/write operations. A closed index can be opened which will then go through the normal recovery process.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The REST endpoint is
							Element:code
								/{index}/_close
								and
							Element:code
								/{index}/_open
								. For example:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								POST /my_index/_close POST /my_index/_open
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								It is possible to open and close multiple indices. An error will be thrown if the request explicitly refers to a missing index. This behaviour can be disabled using the
							Element:code
								ignore_unavailable=true
								parameter.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								All indices can be opened or closed at once using
							Element:code
								_all
								as the index name or specifying patterns that identify them all (e.g.
							Element:code
								*
								).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Identifying indices via wildcards or
							Element:code
								_all
								can be disabled by setting the
							Element:code
								action.destructive_requires_name
								flag in the config file to
							Element:code
								true
								. This setting can also be changed via the cluster update settings api.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Closed indices consume a significant amount of disk-space which can cause problems in managed environments. Closing indices can be disabled via the cluster settings API by setting
							Element:code
								cluster.indices.close.enable
								to
							Element:code
								false
								. The default is
							Element:code
								true
								.
