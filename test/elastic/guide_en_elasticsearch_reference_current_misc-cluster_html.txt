									Node:

											The cluster state maintains index tombstones to explicitly denote indices that have been deleted. The number of tombstones maintained in the cluster state is controlled by the following property, which cannot be updated dynamically:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:dl
										Element:dt
										Element:span
										Element:code
											cluster.indices.tombstones.size
										Element:dd
											Index tombstones prevent nodes that are not part of the cluster when a delete occurs from joining the cluster and reimporting the index as though the delete was never issued. To keep the cluster state from growing huge we only keep the last
										Element:code
											cluster.indices.tombstones.size
											deletes, which defaults to 500. You can increase it if you expect nodes to be absent from the cluster and miss more than 500 deletes. We think that is rare, thus the default. Tombstones don’t take up much space, but we also think that a number like 50,000 is probably too big.
