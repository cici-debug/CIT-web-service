						Node:

							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								post_filter
								is applied to the search
							Element:code
								hits
								at the very end of a search request, after aggregations have already been calculated. Its purpose is best explained by example:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Imagine that you are selling shirts that have the following properties:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								PUT /shirts { "mappings": { "item": { "properties": { "brand": { "type": "keyword"}, "color": { "type": "keyword"}, "model": { "type": "keyword"} } } } } PUT /shirts/item/1?refresh { "brand": "gucci", "color": "red", "model": "slim" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Imagine a user has specified two filters:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:code
								color:red
								and
							Element:code
								brand:gucci
								. You only want to show them red shirts made by Gucci in the search results. Normally you would do this with a
							Element:a
								:
							Element:code
								bool
								query
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET /shirts/_search { "query": { "bool": { "filter": [ { "term": { "color": "red" }}, { "term": { "brand": "gucci" }} ] } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								However, you would also like to use
							Element:span
								to display a list of other options that the user could click on. Perhaps you have a
							Element:em
								faceted navigation
							Element:code
								model
								field that would allow the user to limit their search results to red Gucci
							Element:code
								t-shirts
								or
							Element:code
								dress-shirts
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This can be done with a
							Element:a
								:
							Element:code
								terms
								aggregation
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET /shirts/_search { "query": { "bool": { "filter": [ { "term": { "color": "red" }}, { "term": { "brand": "gucci" }} ] } }, "aggs": { "models": { "terms": { "field": "model" }
							Element:a
							Element:span
								} } }
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:table
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:a
							Element:span
							Element:img
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Returns the most popular models of red shirts by Gucci.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								But perhaps you would also like to tell the user how many Gucci shirts are available in
							Element:span
								. If you just add a
							Element:strong
								other colors
							Element:code
								terms
								aggregation on the
							Element:code
								color
								field, you will only get back the color
							Element:code
								red
								, because your query returns only red shirts by Gucci.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Instead, you want to include shirts of all colors during aggregation, then apply the
							Element:code
								colors
								filter only to the search results. This is the purpose of the
							Element:code
								post_filter
								:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET /shirts/_search { "query": { "bool": { "filter": { "term": { "brand": "gucci" }
							Element:a
							Element:span
								} } }, "aggs": { "colors": { "terms": { "field": "color" }
							Element:img
							Element:a
							Element:span
								}, "color_red": { "filter": { "term": { "color": "red" }
							Element:img
							Element:a
							Element:span
								}, "aggs": { "models": { "terms": { "field": "model" }
							Element:img
							Element:a
							Element:span
								} } } }, "post_filter": {
							Element:img
							Element:a
							Element:span
								"term": { "color": "red" } } }
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:table
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:a
							Element:span
							Element:img
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The main query now finds all shirts by Gucci, regardless of color.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:a
							Element:span
							Element:img
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								colors
								agg returns popular colors for shirts by Gucci.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:a
							Element:span
							Element:img
							Element:a
							Element:span
							Element:img
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								color_red
								agg limits the
							Element:code
								models
								sub-aggregation to
							Element:span
								Gucci shirts.
							Element:strong
								red
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:a
							Element:span
							Element:img
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Finally, the
							Element:code
								post_filter
								removes colors other than red from the search
							Element:code
								hits
								.
