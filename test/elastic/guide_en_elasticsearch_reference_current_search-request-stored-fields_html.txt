								The
							Element:code
								stored_fields
								parameter is about fields that are explicitly marked as stored in the mapping, which is off by default and generally not recommended. Use
							Element:a
								source filtering
								instead to select subsets of the original source document to be returned.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Allows to selectively load specific stored fields for each document represented by a search hit.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET /_search { "stored_fields" : ["user", "postDate"], "query" : { "term" : { "user" : "kimchy" } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:code
								*
								can be used to load all stored fields from the document.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								An empty array will cause only the
							Element:code
								_id
								and
							Element:code
								_type
								for each hit to be returned, for example:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET /_search { "stored_fields" : [], "query" : { "term" : { "user" : "kimchy" } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If the requested fields are not stored (
							Element:code
								store
								mapping set to
							Element:code
								false
								), they will be ignored.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Stored field values fetched from the document itself are always returned as an array. On the contrary, metadata fields like
							Element:code
								_routing
								and
							Element:code
								_parent
								fields are never returned as an array.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Also only leaf fields can be returned via the
							Element:code
								field
								option. So object fields can’t be returned and such requests will fail.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Script fields can also be automatically detected and used as fields, so things like
							Element:code
								_source.obj1.field1
								can be used, though not recommended, as
							Element:code
								obj1.field1
								will work as well.
