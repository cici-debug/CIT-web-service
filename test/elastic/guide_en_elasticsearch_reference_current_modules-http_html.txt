										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											http.compression_level
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Defines the compression level to use for HTTP responses. Valid values are in the range of 1 (minimum compression) and 9 (maximum compression). Defaults to
										Element:code

											.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											http.cors.enabled
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Enable or disable cross-origin resource sharing, i.e. whether a browser on another origin can execute requests against Elasticsearch. Set to
										Element:code
											true
											to enable Elasticsearch to process pre-flight
										Element:a
											CORS
											requests. Elasticsearch will respond to those requests with the
										Element:code
											Access-Control-Allow-Origin
											header if the
										Element:code
											Origin
											sent in the request is permitted by the
										Element:code
											http.cors.allow-origin
											list. Set to
										Element:code
											false
											(the default) to make Elasticsearch ignore the
										Element:code
											Origin
											request header, effectively disabling CORS requests because Elasticsearch will never respond with the
										Element:code
											Access-Control-Allow-Origin
											response header. Note that if the client does not send a pre-flight request with an
										Element:code
											Origin
											header or it does not check the response headers from the server to validate the
										Element:code
											Access-Control-Allow-Origin
											response header, then cross-origin security is compromised. If CORS is not enabled on Elasticsearch, the only way for the client to know is to send a pre-flight request and realize the required response headers are missing.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											http.cors.allow-origin
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Which origins to allow. Defaults to no origins allowed. If you prepend and append a
										Element:code
											/
											to the value, this will be treated as a regular expression, allowing you to support HTTP and HTTPs. for example using
										Element:code
											/https?:\/\/localhost(:[0-9]+)?/
											would return the request header appropriately in both cases.
										Element:code
											*
											is a valid value but is considered a
										Element:span
											as your elasticsearch instance is open to cross origin requests from
										Element:strong
											security risk
										Element:span
											.
										Element:strong
											anywhere
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											http.cors.max-age
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Browsers send a "preflight" OPTIONS-request to determine CORS settings.
										Element:code
											max-age
											defines how long the result should be cached for. Defaults to
										Element:code
											1728000
											(20 days)
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											http.cors.allow-methods
										Element:td

											.

										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											http.cors.allow-headers

											.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											http.cors.allow-credentials
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Whether the
										Element:code
											Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
											header should be returned. Note: This header is only returned, when the setting is set to
										Element:code
											true
											. Defaults to
										Element:code
											false
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											http.detailed_errors.enabled
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Enables or disables the output of detailed error messages and stack traces in response output. Note: When set to
										Element:code
											false
											and the
										Element:code
											error_trace
											request parameter is specified, an error will be returned; when
										Element:code
											error_trace
											is not specified, a simple message will be returned. Defaults to
										Element:code
											true
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											http.pipelining
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Enable or disable HTTP pipelining, defaults to

										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											http.pipelining.max_events
										Element:td
										Element:p

										Element:p
											The http module can be completely disabled and not started by setting
										Element:code
											http.enabled
											to
										Element:code
											false
											. Elasticsearch nodes (and Java clients) communicate internally using the
										Element:a
											transport interface
											, not HTTP. It might make sense to disable the
										Element:code
											http
											layer entirely on nodes which are not meant to serve REST requests directly. For instance, you could disable HTTP on
										Element:a
											data-only nodes
											if you also have
										Element:a
											client nodes
											which are intended to serve all REST requests. Be aware, however, that you will not be able to send any REST requests (eg to retrieve node stats) directly to nodes which have HTTP disabled.
