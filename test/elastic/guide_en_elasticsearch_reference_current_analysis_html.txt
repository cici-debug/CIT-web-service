											At index time, if no

								Search time analysis

								edit
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								This same analysis process is applied to the query string at search time in
							Element:a
								full text queries
								like the
							Element:a
								to convert the text in the query string into terms of the same form as those that are stored in the inverted index.
							Element:code
								match
								query
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For instance, a user might search for:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								"a quick fox"
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								which would be analysed by the same
							Element:code
								english
								analyzer into the following terms:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								[ quick, fox ]
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Even though the exact words used in the query string don’t appear in the original text (
							Element:code
								quick
								vs
							Element:code
								QUICK
								,
							Element:code
								fox
								vs
							Element:code
								foxes
								), because we have applied the same analyzer to both the text and the query string, the terms from the query string exactly match the terms from the text in the inverted index, which means that this query would match our example document.
