								Norms store various normalization factors that are later used at query time in order to compute the score of a document relatively to a query.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Although useful for scoring, norms also require quite a lot of disk (typically in the order of one byte per document per field in your index, even for documents that don’t have this specific field). As a consequence, if you don’t need scoring on a specific field, you should disable norms on that field. In particular, this is the case for fields that are used solely for filtering or aggregations.

								The
							Element:code
								norms
								setting must have the same setting for fields of the same name in the same index. Norms can be disabled on existing fields using the
							Element:a
								PUT mapping API
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Norms can be disabled (but not reenabled) after the fact, using the
							Element:a
								PUT mapping API
								like so:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								PUT my_index/_mapping/my_type { "properties": { "title": { "type": "text", "norms": false } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Norms will not be removed instantly, but will be removed as old segments are merged into new segments as you continue indexing new documents. Any score computation on a field that has had norms removed might return inconsistent results since some documents won’t have norms anymore while other documents might still have norms.
