								The field data cache is used mainly when sorting on or computing aggregations on a field. It loads all the field values to memory in order to provide fast document based access to those values. The field data cache can be expensive to build for a field, so its recommended to have enough memory to allocate it, and to keep it loaded.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The amount of memory used for the field data cache can be controlled using
							Element:code
								indices.fielddata.cache.size
								. Note: reloading the field data which does not fit into your cache will be expensive and perform poorly.

								The max size of the field data cache, eg

								30%
								of node heap space, or an absolute value, eg
							Element:code
								12GB
								. Defaults to unbounded. Also see
