														By default, Elasticsearch will use whatever similarity is configured as
													Element:code
														default
														. However, the similarity functions
													Element:code
														queryNorm()
														and
													Element:code
														coord()
														are not per-field. Consequently, for expert users wanting to change the implementation used for these two methods, while not changing the
													Element:code
														default
														, it is possible to configure a similarity with the name
													Element:code
														base
														. This similarity will then be used for the two methods.
												Node:

														You can change the default similarity for all fields in an index when it is

														created
														:
												Node:

														PUT /my_index { "settings": { "index": { "similarity": { "default": { "type": "classic" } } } } }
												Node:

														If you want to change the default similarity after creating the index you must
													Element:a
														close
														your index, send the follwing request and
													Element:a
														open
														it again afterwards:
												Node:
