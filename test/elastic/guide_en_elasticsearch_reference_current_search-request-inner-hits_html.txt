						Node:

							Element:p
								The
							Element:a
								parent/child
								and
							Element:a
								nested
								features allow the return of documents that have matches in a different scope. In the parent/child case, parent documents are returned based on matches in child documents or child documents are returned based on matches in parent documents. In the nested case, documents are returned based on matches in nested inner objects.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In both cases, the actual matches in the different scopes that caused a document to be returned is hidden. In many cases, it’s very useful to know which inner nested objects (in the case of nested) or children/parent documents (in the case of parent/child) caused certain information to be returned. The inner hits feature can be used for this. This feature returns per search hit in the search response additional nested hits that caused a search hit to match in a different scope.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Inner hits can be used by defining an
							Element:code
								inner_hits
								definition on a
							Element:code
								nested
								,
							Element:code
								has_child
								or
							Element:code
								has_parent
								query and filter. The structure looks like this:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								"<query>" : { "inner_hits" : { <inner_hits_options> } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If
							Element:code
								inner_hits
								is defined on a query that supports it then each search hit will contain an
							Element:code
								inner_hits
								json object with the following structure:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								"hits": [ { "_index": ..., "_type": ..., "_id": ..., "inner_hits": { "<inner_hits_name>": { "hits": { "total": ..., "hits": [ { "_type": ..., "_id": ..., ... }, ... ] } } }, ... }, ... ]

										Element:tr

										Element:p
										Element:code
											name
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The name to be used for the particular inner hit definition in the response. Useful when multiple inner hits have been defined in a single search request. The default depends in which query the inner hit is defined. For
										Element:code
											has_child
											query and filter this is the child type,
										Element:code
											has_parent
											query and filter this is the parent type and the nested query and filter this is the nested path.

											The nested

											can be used to include nested inner objects as inner hits to a search hit.
									Node:

										Element:p
											The example below assumes that there is a nested object field defined with the name
										Element:code
											comments
											:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "query" : { "nested" : { "path" : "comments", "query" : { "match" : {"comments.message" : "[actual query]"} }, "inner_hits" : {}
										Element:a
										Element:span
											} } }

									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The inner hit definition in the nested query. No other options need to be defined.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											An example of a response snippet that could be generated from the above search request:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											... "hits": { ... "hits": [ { "_index": "my-index", "_type": "question", "_id": "1", "_source": ..., "inner_hits": { "comments": {
										Element:a
										Element:span
											"hits": { "total": ..., "hits": [ { "_nested": { "field": "comments", "offset": 2 }, "_source": ... }, ... ] } } } }, ...
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The name used in the inner hit definition in the search request. A custom key can be used via the
										Element:code
											name
											option.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											_nested
											metadata is crucial in the above example, because it defines from what inner nested object this inner hit came from. The
										Element:code
											field
											defines the object array field the nested hit is from and the
										Element:code
											offset
											relative to its location in the
										Element:code
											_source
											. Due to sorting and scoring the actual location of the hit objects in the
										Element:code
											inner_hits
											is usually different than the location a nested inner object was defined.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											By default the
										Element:code
											_source
											is returned also for the hit objects in
										Element:code
											inner_hits
											, but this can be changed. Either via
										Element:code
											_source
											filtering feature part of the source can be returned or be disabled. If stored fields are defined on the nested level these can also be returned via the
										Element:code
											fields
											feature.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											An important default is that the
										Element:code
											_source
											returned in hits inside
										Element:code
											inner_hits
											is relative to the
										Element:code
											_nested
											metadata. So in the above example only the comment part is returned per nested hit and not the entire source of the top level document that contained the comment.

											Hierarchical levels of nested object fields and inner hits.
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If a mapping has multiple levels of hierarchical nested object fields each level can be accessed via dot notated path. For example if there is a
										Element:code
											comments
											nested field that contains a
										Element:code
											votes
											nested field and votes should directly be returned with the root hits then the following path can be defined:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "query" : { "nested" : { "path" : "comments.votes", "query" : { ... }, "inner_hits" : {} } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This indirect referencing is only supported for nested inner hits.

											{ "query" : { "has_child" : { "type" : "comment", "query" : { "match" : {"message" : "[actual query]"} }, "inner_hits" : {}
