								This functionality is experimental and may be changed or removed completely in a future release. Elastic will take a best effort approach to fix any issues, but experimental features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

								Serial differencing is a technique where values in a time series are subtracted from itself at different time lags or periods. For example, the datapoint f(x) = f(x
							Element:sub
								t
								) - f(x
							Element:sub
								t-n
								), where n is the period being used.
						Node:
						(type) c

								A period of 1 is equivalent to a derivative with no time normalization: it is simply the change from one point to the next. Single periods are useful for removing constant, linear trends.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Single periods are also useful for transforming data into a stationary series. In this example, the Dow Jones is plotted over ~250 days. The raw data is not stationary, which would make it difficult to use with some techniques.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								By calculating the first-difference, we de-trend the data (e.g. remove a constant, linear trend). We can see that the data becomes a stationary series (e.g. the first difference is randomly distributed around zero, and doesn’t seem to exhibit any pattern/behavior). The transformation reveals that the dataset is following a random-walk; the value is the previous value +/- a random amount. This insight allows selection of further tools for analysis.

								Larger periods can be used to remove seasonal / cyclic behavior. In this example, a population of lemmings was synthetically generated with a sine wave + constant linear trend + random noise. The sine wave has a period of 30 days.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The first-difference removes the constant trend, leaving just a sine wave. The 30th-difference is then applied to the first-difference to remove the cyclic behavior, leaving a stationary series which is amenable to other analysis.

											histogram
											or

											date_histogram
											over a field. You can then optionally add normal metrics, such as a

											sum
											, inside of that histogram. Finally, the
										Element:code
											serial_diff
											is embedded inside the histogram. The
										Element:code
											buckets_path
											parameter is then used to "point" at one of the sibling metrics inside of the histogram (see

											the section called “
										Element:code
											buckets_path
											Syntax

											edit
											” for a description of the syntax for
