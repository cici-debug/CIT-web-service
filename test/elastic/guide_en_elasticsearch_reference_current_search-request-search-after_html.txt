								Pagination of results can be done by using the
							Element:code
								from
								and
							Element:code
								size
								but the cost becomes prohibitive when the deep pagination is reached. The
							Element:code
								index.max_result_window
								which defaults to 10,000 is a safeguard, search requests take heap memory and time proportional to
							Element:code
								from + size
								. The
							Element:a
								Scroll
								api is recommended for efficient deep scrolling but scroll contexts are costly and it is not recommended to use it for real time user requests. The
							Element:code
								search_after
								parameter circumvents this problem by providing a live cursor. The idea is to use the results from the previous page to help the retrieval of the next page.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Suppose that the query to retrieve the first page looks like this:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET twitter/tweet/_search { "size": 10, "query": { "match" : { "title" : "elasticsearch" } }, "sort": [ {"date": "asc"}, {"_uid": "desc"} ] }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A field with one unique value per document should be used as the tiebreaker of the sort specification. Otherwise the sort order for documents that have the same sort values would be undefined. The recommended way is to use the field
							Element:code
								_uid
								which is certain to contain one unique value for each document.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The result from the above request includes an array of
							Element:code
								sort values
								for each document. These
							Element:code
								sort values
								can be used in conjunction with the
							Element:code
								search_after
								parameter to start returning results "after" any document in the result list. For instance we can use the
							Element:code
								sort values
								of the last document and pass it to
							Element:code
								search_after
								to retrieve the next page of results:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET twitter/tweet/_search { "size": 10, "query": { "match" : { "title" : "elasticsearch" } }, "search_after": [1463538857, "tweet#654323"], "sort": [ {"date": "asc"}, {"_uid": "desc"} ] }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The parameter
							Element:code
								from
								must be set to 0 (or -1) when
							Element:code
								search_after
								is used.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:code
								search_after
								is not a solution to jump freely to a random page but rather to scroll many queries in parallel. It is very similar to the
							Element:code
								scroll
								API but unlike it, the
							Element:code
								search_after
								parameter is stateless, it is always resolved against the latest version of the searcher. For this reason the sort order may change during a walk depending on the updates and deletes of your index.
