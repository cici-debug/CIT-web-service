														The

														0
														.
												Node:

														The

														search type was deprecated since version 2.1.0 and is now removed. All benefits from this search type can now be achieved by doing a scroll request that sorts documents in
													Element:code
														_doc
														order, for instance:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														GET /my_index/_search?scroll=2m { "sort": [ "_doc" ] }
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Scroll requests sorted by
													Element:code
														_doc
														have been optimized to more efficiently resume from where the previous request stopped, so this will have the same performance characteristics as the former
													Element:code
														scan
														search type.

											Search shard limit
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In 5.0, Elasticsearch rejects requests that would query more than 1000 shard copies (primaries or replicas). The reason is that such large numbers of shards make the job of the coordinating node very CPU and memory intensive. It is usually a better idea to organize data in such a way that there are fewer larger shards. In case you would like to bypass this limit, which is discouraged, you can update the
										Element:code
											action.search.shard_count.limit
											cluster setting to a greater value.

										Element:li
											The

											score_type

											has_child
											queries has been removed in favour of

											score_mode

											score_mode
											parameter to

										Element:code
											score
											boolean parameter. Also, the
										Element:code
											total
											score mode has been removed in favour of the

											mode.
										Element:li
											When the
										Element:code
											max_children
											parameter was set to
										Element:code
											0
											on the
										Element:code
											has_child
											query then there was no upper limit on how many child documents were allowed to match. Now,
										Element:code
											0
											really means that zero child documents are allowed. If no upper limit is needed then the

											max_children

										Element:li
											The

											and
										Element:code
											has_parent
											queries. Use cases previously only possible with top level inner hits can now be done with inner hits defined inside the query dsl.
										Element:li
											Source filtering for inner hits inside nested queries requires full field names instead of relative field names. This is now consistent for source filtering on other places in the search API.
										Element:li
											Nested inner hits will now no longer include
										Element:code
											_index
											,
										Element:code

											The

											search preference
										Element:code

										Element:code
											_prefer_nodes

											but also supports specifying multiple nodes.
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:a
											search preference
										Element:code
											_shards
											accepts a secondary preference, for example

											_primary
											to specify the primary copy of the specified shards. The separator previously used to separate the
										Element:code
											_shards
											portion of the parameter from the secondary preference was
										Element:code
											;
											. However, this is also an acceptable separator between query string parameters which means that unless the
										Element:code
											;
											was escaped, the secondary preference was never observed. The separator has been changed to
										Element:code
											|
											and does not need to be escaped.
