					You can use ingest node to pre-process documents before the actual indexing takes place. This pre-processing happens by an ingest node that intercepts bulk and index requests, applies the transformations, and then passes the documents back to the index or bulk APIs.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					You can enable ingest on any node or even have dedicated ingest nodes. Ingest is enabled by default on all nodes. To disable ingest on a node, configure the following setting in the
				Element:code
					elasticsearch.yml
					file:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
					node.ingest: false
			Node:
			(type) c

				Element:p
					To pre-process documents before indexing, you
				Element:a
					define a pipeline
					that specifies a series of
				Element:a
					processors
					. Each processor transforms the document in some way. For example, you may have a pipeline that consists of one processor that removes a field from the document followed by another processor that renames a field.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					To use a pipeline, you simply specify the
				Element:code
					pipeline
					parameter on an index or bulk request to tell the ingest node which pipeline to use. For example:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
					PUT my-index/my-type/my-id?pipeline=my_pipeline_id { "foo": "bar" }
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					See
				Element:a
					Ingest APIs
					for more information about creating, adding, and deleting pipelines.
