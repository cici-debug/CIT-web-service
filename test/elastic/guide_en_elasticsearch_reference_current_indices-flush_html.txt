								The flush API allows to flush one or more indices through an API. The flush process of an index basically frees memory from the index by flushing data to the index storage and clearing the internal
							Element:a
								transaction log
								. By default, Elasticsearch uses memory heuristics in order to automatically trigger flush operations as required in order to clear memory.

											The flush API accepts the following request parameters:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:colgroup
										Element:col
										Element:col
										Element:tbody
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											wait_if_ongoing
										Element:td
										Element:p
											If set to
										Element:code
											true
											the flush operation will block until the flush can be executed if another flush operation is already executing. The default is
										Element:code
											false
											and will cause an exception to be thrown on the shard level if another flush operation is already running.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											force
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Whether a flush should be forced even if it is not necessarily needed ie. if no changes will be committed to the index. This is useful if transaction log IDs should be incremented even if no uncommitted changes are present. (This setting can be considered as internal)
