						Node:

							Element:p
								A query that matches documents matching boolean combinations of other queries. The bool query maps to Lucene
							Element:code
								BooleanQuery
								. It is built using one or more boolean clauses, each clause with a typed occurrence. The occurrence types are:
						Node:

							Element:col

								Description
							Element:tbody
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								must
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The clause (query) must appear in matching documents and will contribute to the score.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								filter
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The clause (query) must appear in matching documents. However unlike
							Element:code
								must
								the score of the query will be ignored. Filter clauses are executed in
							Element:a
								filter context
								, meaning that scoring is ignored and clauses are considered for caching.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								should
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The clause (query) should appear in the matching document. In a boolean query with no
							Element:code
								must
								or
							Element:code
								filter
								clauses, one or more
							Element:code
								should
								clauses must match a document. The minimum number of should clauses to match can be set using the
							Element:a
								parameter.
							Element:code
								minimum_should_match
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								must_not
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The clause (query) must not appear in the matching documents. Clauses are executed in
							Element:a
								filter context
								meaning that scoring is ignored and clauses are considered for caching. Because scoring is ignored, a score of
							Element:code
								0
								for all documents is returned.

											Bool query in filter context
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If this query is used in a filter context and it has
										Element:code
											should
											clauses then at least one
										Element:code
											should
											clause is required to match.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The bool query also supports
										Element:code
											disable_coord
											parameter (defaults to
										Element:code
											false
											). Basically the coord similarity computes a score factor based on the fraction of all query terms that a document contains. See Lucene
										Element:code
											BooleanQuery
											for more details.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											bool
											query takes a
										Element:span
											approach, so the score from each matching
										Element:em
											more-matches-is-better
										Element:code
											must
											or
										Element:code
											should
											clause will be added together to provide the final
										Element:code
											_score
											for each document.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											POST _search { "query": { "bool" : { "must" : { "term" : { "user" : "kimchy" } }, "filter": { "term" : { "tag" : "tech" } }, "must_not" : { "range" : { "age" : { "gte" : 10, "lte" : 20 } } }, "should" : [ { "term" : { "tag" : "wow" } }, { "term" : { "tag" : "elasticsearch" } } ], "minimum_should_match" : 1, "boost" : 1.0 } } }

									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Queries specified under the
										Element:code
											filter
											element have no effect on scoring — scores are returned as
										Element:code
											0
											. Scores are only affected by the query that has been specified. For instance, all three of the following queries return all documents where the
										Element:code
											status
											field contains the term
										Element:code
											active
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This first query assigns a score of
										Element:code
											0
											to all documents, as no scoring query has been specified:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET _search { "query": { "bool": { "filter": { "term": { "status": "active" } } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This
										Element:code
											bool
											query has a
										Element:code
											match_all
											query, which assigns a score of
										Element:code
											1.0
											to all documents.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET _search { "query": { "bool": { "must": { "match_all": {} }, "filter": { "term": { "status": "active" } } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This
										Element:code
											constant_score
											query behaves in exactly the same way as the second example above. The
										Element:code
											constant_score
											query assigns a score of
										Element:code
											1.0
											to all documents matched by the filter.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET _search { "query": { "constant_score": { "filter": { "term": { "status": "active" } } } } }

											If you need to know which of the clauses in the bool query matched the documents returned from the query, you can use

											named queries
											to assign a name to each clause.
