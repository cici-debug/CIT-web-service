								In addition to being able to index, update, and delete individual documents, Elasticsearch also provides the ability to perform any of the above operations in batches using the
							Element:a
								. This functionality is important in that it provides a very efficient mechanism to do multiple operations as fast as possible with as few network roundtrips as possible.

								API
						Node:

								As a quick example, the following call indexes two documents (ID 1 - John Doe and ID 2 - Jane Doe) in one bulk operation:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								POST /customer/external/_bulk?pretty {"index":{"_id":"1"}} {"name": "John Doe" } {"index":{"_id":"2"}} {"name": "Jane Doe" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This example updates the first document (ID of 1) and then deletes the second document (ID of 2) in one bulk operation:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								POST /customer/external/_bulk?pretty {"update":{"_id":"1"}} {"doc": { "name": "John Doe becomes Jane Doe" } } {"delete":{"_id":"2"}}
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Note above that for the delete action, there is no corresponding source document after it since deletes only require the ID of the document to be deleted.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The Bulk API does not fail due to failures in one of the actions. If a single action fails for whatever reason, it will continue to process the remainder of the actions after it. When the bulk API returns, it will provide a status for each action (in the same order it was sent in) so that you can check if a specific action failed or not.
