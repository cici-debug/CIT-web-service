											index.number_of_shards
										Element:dd
											The number of primary shards that an index should have. Defaults to 5. This setting can only be set at index creation time. It cannot be changed on a closed index. Note: the number of shards are limited to
										Element:code
											1024
											per index. This limitation is a safety limit to prevent accidental creation of indices that can destabilize a cluster due to resource allocation. The limit can be modified by specifying

											system property on every node that is part of the cluster.

											Auto-expand the number of replicas based on the number of available nodes. Set to a dash delimited lower and upper bound (e.g.

											) or use

											for the upper bound (e.g.
