								A

								multi-value
								metrics aggregation that computes stats over numeric values extracted from the aggregated documents. These values can be extracted either from specific numeric fields in the documents, or be generated by a provided script.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								extended_stats
								aggregations is an extended version of the
							Element:a
								aggregation, where additional metrics are added such as
							Element:code
								stats
							Element:code
								sum_of_squares
								,
							Element:code
								variance
								,
							Element:code
								std_deviation
								and
							Element:code
								std_deviation_bounds
								.
						Node:

								Assuming the data consists of documents representing exams grades (between 0 and 100) of students
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "aggs" : { "grades_stats" : { "extended_stats" : { "field" : "grade" } } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The above aggregation computes the grades statistics over all documents. The aggregation type is
							Element:code
								extended_stats
								and the
							Element:code
								field
								setting defines the numeric field of the documents the stats will be computed on. The above will return the following:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ ... "aggregations": { "grade_stats": { "count": 9, "min": 72, "max": 99, "avg": 86, "sum": 774, "sum_of_squares": 67028, "variance": 51.55555555555556, "std_deviation": 7.180219742846005, "std_deviation_bounds": { "upper": 100.36043948569201, "lower": 71.63956051430799 } } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The name of the aggregation (
							Element:code
								grades_stats
								above) also serves as the key by which the aggregation result can be retrieved from the returned response.

									Node:

										Element:p
											By default, the
										Element:code
											extended_stats
											metric will return an object called
										Element:code
											std_deviation_bounds
											, which provides an interval of plus/minus two standard deviations from the mean. This can be a useful way to visualize variance of your data. If you want a different boundary, for example three standard deviations, you can set
										Element:code
											sigma
											in the request:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "aggs" : { "grades_stats" : { "extended_stats" : { "field" : "grade", "sigma" : 3
										Element:a

											controls how many standard deviations +/- from the mean should be displayed
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:code
											sigma
											can be any non-negative double, meaning you can request non-integer values such as
										Element:code
											1.5
											. A value of
										Element:code
											0
											is valid, but will simply return the average for both
										Element:code
											upper
											and
										Element:code
											lower
											bounds.

											Standard Deviation and Bounds require normality
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The standard deviation and its bounds are displayed by default, but they are not always applicable to all data-sets. Your data must be normally distributed for the metrics to make sense. The statistics behind standard deviations assumes normally distributed data, so if your data is skewed heavily left or right, the value returned will be misleading.

											Computing the grades stats based on a script:
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ ..., "aggs" : { "grades_stats" : { "extended_stats" : { "script" : { "inline" : "doc['grade'].value", "lang" : "painless" } } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This will interpret the
										Element:code
											script
											parameter as an
										Element:code
											inline
											script with the
										Element:code
											painless
											script language and no script parameters. To use a file script use the following syntax:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ ..., "aggs" : { "grades_stats" : { "extended_stats" : { "script" : { "file": "my_script", "params": { "field": "grade" } } } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c

											for indexed scripts replace the
										Element:code
											file
											parameter with an
										Element:code
											id
											parameter.

											The

											missing
											parameter defines how documents that are missing a value should be treated. By default they will be ignored but it is also possible to treat them as if they had a value.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "aggs" : { "grades_stats" : { "extended_stats" : { "field" : "grade", "missing": 0
										Element:a
