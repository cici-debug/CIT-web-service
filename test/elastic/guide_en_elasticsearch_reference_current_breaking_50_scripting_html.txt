											Switched Default Language from Groovy to Painless
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The default scripting language for Elasticsearch is now Painless. Painless is a custom-built language with syntax similar to Groovy designed to be fast as well as secure. Many Groovy scripts will be identitical to Painless scripts to help make the transition between languages as simple as possible.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Documentation for Painless can be found at
										Element:a
											Painless Scripting Language
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											One common difference to note between Groovy and Painless is the use of parameters — all parameters in Painless must be prefixed with
										Element:code
											params.
											now. The following example shows the difference:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Groovy:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "script_score": { "script": { "lang": "groovy", "inline": "Math.log(_score * 2) + my_modifier", "params": { "my_modifier": 8 } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Painless (
										Element:code
											my_modifer
											is prefixed with
										Element:code
											params
											):
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "script_score": { "script": { "lang": "painless", "inline": "Math.log(_score * 2) + params.my_modifier", "params": { "my_modifier": 8 } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											script.default_lang
											setting has been removed. It is no longer possible set the default scripting language. If a different language than
										Element:code
											painless
											is used then this should be explicitly specified on the script itself.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											For scripts with no explicit language defined, that are part of already stored percolator queries, the default language can be controlled with the
										Element:code
											script.legacy.default_lang
											setting.

											Removed 1.x script and template syntax
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The deprecated 1.x syntax of defining inline scripts / templates and referring to file or index base scripts / templates have been removed.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											script
											and
										Element:code
											params
											string parameters can no longer be used and instead the
										Element:code
											script
											object syntax must be used. This applies for the update api, script sort,
										Element:code
											script_score
											function,
										Element:code
											script
											query,
										Element:code
											scripted_metric
											aggregation and
										Element:code
											script_heuristic
											aggregation.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											So this usage of inline scripts is no longer allowed:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "script_score": { "lang": "groovy", "script": "Math.log(_score * 2) + my_modifier", "params": { "my_modifier": 8 } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3

											and instead this syntax must be used:
									Node:

										Element:pre
											{ "script_score": { "script": { "lang": "groovy", "inline": "Math.log(_score * 2) + my_modifier", "params": { "my_modifier": 8 } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											script
											or
										Element:code
											script_file
											parameter can no longer be used to refer to file based scripts and templates and instead
										Element:code
											file
											must be used.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This usage of referring to file based scripts is no longer valid:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "script_score": { "script": "calculate-score", "params": { "my_modifier": 8 } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3

											This usage is valid:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre

									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											script_id
											parameter can no longer be used the refer to indexed based scripts and templates and instead
										Element:code
											id
											must be used.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This usage of referring to indexed scripts is no longer valid:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "script_score": { "script_id": "indexedCalculateScore", "params": { "my_modifier": 8 } } }
									Node:

											This usage is valid:
									Node:

									Node:

											Indexed scripts and templates

									Node:

										Element:p
											Indexed scripts and templates have been replaced by
										Element:a
											stored scripts
											which stores the scripts and templates in the cluster state instead of a dedicate
										Element:code
											.scripts
											index.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											For the size of stored scripts there is a soft limit of 65535 bytes. If scripts exceed that size then the
										Element:code
											script.max_size_in_bytes
											setting can be added to elasticsearch.yml to change the soft limit to a higher value. If scripts are really large, other options like native scripts should be considered.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Previously indexed scripts in the
										Element:code
											.scripts
											index will not be used any more as Elasticsearch will now try to fetch the scripts from the cluster state. Upon upgrading to 5.x the
										Element:code
											.scripts
											index will remain to exist, so it can be used by a script to migrate the stored scripts from the
										Element:code
											.scripts
											index into the cluster state. The current format of the scripts and templates hasn’t been changed, only the 1.x format has been removed.
