								Nested query allows to query nested objects / docs (see
							Element:a
								nested mapping
								). The query is executed against the nested objects / docs as if they were indexed as separate docs (they are, internally) and resulting in the root parent doc (or parent nested mapping). Here is a sample mapping we will work with:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								PUT /my_index { "mappings": { "type1" : { "properties" : { "obj1" : { "type" : "nested" } } } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								And here is a sample nested query usage:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET /_search { "query": { "nested" : { "path" : "obj1", "score_mode" : "avg", "query" : { "bool" : { "must" : [ { "match" : {"obj1.name" : "blue"} }, { "range" : {"obj1.count" : {"gt" : 5}} } ] } } } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The query
							Element:code
								path
								points to the nested object path, and the
							Element:code
								query
								includes the query that will run on the nested docs matching the direct path, and joining with the root parent docs. Note that any fields referenced inside the query must use the complete path (fully qualified).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								score_mode
								allows to set how inner children matching affects scoring of parent. It defaults to
							Element:code
								avg
								, but can be
							Element:code
								sum
								,
							Element:code
								min
								,
							Element:code
								max
								and
							Element:code
								none
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								There is also an
							Element:code
								ignore_unmapped
								option which, when set to
							Element:code
								true
								will ignore an unmapped
							Element:code
								path
								and will not match any documents for this query. This can be useful when querying multiple indexes which might have different mappings. When set to
							Element:code
								false
								(the default value) the query will throw an exception if the
							Element:code
								path
								is not mapped.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Multi level nesting is automatically supported, and detected, resulting in an inner nested query to automatically match the relevant nesting level (and not root) if it exists within another nested query.
