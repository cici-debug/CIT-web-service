							Element:p
								A filtering aggregation used to limit any sub aggregations' processing to a sample of the top-scoring documents.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Example use cases:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Tightening the focus of analytics to high-relevance matches rather than the potentially very long tail of low-quality matches
							Element:li
								Reducing the running cost of aggregations that can produce useful results using only samples e.g.
							Element:code
								significant_terms
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Example:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "query": { "match": { "text": "iphone" } }, "aggs": { "sample": { "sampler": { "shard_size": 200 }, "aggs": { "keywords": { "significant_terms": { "field": "text" } } } } } }

						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ ... "aggregations": { "sample": { "doc_count": 1000,

								"keywords": { "doc_count": 1000, "buckets": [ ... { "key": "bend", "doc_count": 58, "score": 37.982536582524276, "bg_count": 103 }, .... }

								1000 documents were sampled in total because we asked for a maximum of 200 from an index with 5 shards. The cost of performing the nested significant_terms aggregation was therefore limited rather than unbounded.

														Being a quality-based filter the sampler aggregation needs access to the relevance score produced for each document. It therefore cannot be nested under a

														terms
														aggregation which has the
													Element:code
														collect_mode
														switched from the default
													Element:code
														depth_first
														mode to
													Element:code
														breadth_first
														as this discards scores. In this situation an error will be thrown.
