								Percentile rank show the percentage of observed values which are below certain value. For example, if a value is greater than or equal to 95% of the observed values it is said to be at the 95th percentile rank.

								Assume your data consists of website load times. You may have a service agreement that 95% of page loads completely within 15ms and 99% of page loads complete within 30ms.
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Let’s look at a range of percentiles representing load time:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "aggs" : { "load_time_outlier" : { "percentile_ranks" : { "field" : "load_time",
							Element:a
							Element:span
								"values" : [15, 30] } } } }
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:table
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:a
							Element:span
							Element:img
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The field
							Element:code
								load_time
								must be a numeric field
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The response will look like this:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ ... "aggregations": { "load_time_outlier": { "values" : { "15": 92, "30": 100 } } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								From this information you can determine you are hitting the 99% load time target but not quite hitting the 95% load time target

											The percentile rank metric supports scripting. For example, if our load times are in milliseconds but we want to specify values in seconds, we could use a script to convert them on-the-fly:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "aggs" : { "load_time_outlier" : { "percentile_ranks" : { "values" : [3, 5], "script" : { "lang": "painless", "inline": "doc['load_time'].value / params.timeUnit",
										Element:a
										Element:span
											"params" : { "timeUnit" : 1000
										Element:img
										Element:a
										Element:span
											} } } } } }
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											field
											parameter is replaced with a
										Element:code
											script
											parameter, which uses the script to generate values which percentile ranks are calculated on
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Scripting supports parameterized input just like any other script
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This will interpret the
										Element:code
											script
											parameter as an
										Element:code
											inline
											script with the
										Element:code
											painless
											script language and no script parameters. To use a file script use the following syntax:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "aggs" : { "load_time_outlier" : { "percentile_ranks" : { "values" : [3, 5], "script" : { "file": "my_script", "params" : { "timeUnit" : 1000 } } } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											for indexed scripts replace the
										Element:code
											file
											parameter with an
										Element:code
											id
											parameter.

											HDR Histogram
											(High Dynamic Range Histogram) is an alternative implementation that can be useful when calculating percentile ranks for latency measurements as it can be faster than the t-digest implementation with the trade-off of a larger memory footprint. This implementation maintains a fixed worse-case percentage error (specified as a number of significant digits). This means that if data is recorded with values from 1 microsecond up to 1 hour (3,600,000,000 microseconds) in a histogram set to 3 significant digits, it will maintain a value resolution of 1 microsecond for values up to 1 millisecond and 3.6 seconds (or better) for the maximum tracked value (1 hour).
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The HDR Histogram can be used by specifying the
										Element:code
											method
											parameter in the request:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "aggs" : { "load_time_outlier" : { "percentile_ranks" : { "field" : "load_time", "values" : [15, 30], "hdr": {
										Element:a
										Element:span
											"number_of_significant_value_digits" : 3
										Element:img
										Element:a
										Element:span

										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:a
										Element:span
										Element:img
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											number_of_significant_value_digits
											specifies the resolution of values for the histogram in number of significant digits
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The HDRHistogram only supports positive values and will error if it is passed a negative value. It is also not a good idea to use the HDRHistogram if the range of values is unknown as this could lead to high memory usage.

											The

									Node:

										Element:pre
