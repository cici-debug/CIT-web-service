								The

										Element:a

									Node:

										Element:p
											Though very handy to have around, the source field does incur storage overhead within the index. For this reason, it can be disabled as follows:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											PUT tweets { "mappings": { "tweet": { "_source": { "enabled": false } } } }
									Node:

											Think before disabling the
										Element:code
											_source
											field
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Users often disable the
										Element:code
											_source
											field without thinking about the consequences, and then live to regret it. If the
										Element:code
											_source
											field isn’t available then a number of features are not supported:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											The
										Element:a
											,
										Element:code
											update
										Element:a
											, and
										Element:code
											update_by_query
										Element:a
											APIs.
										Element:code
											reindex
										Element:li
											On the fly
										Element:a
											highlighting
											.
										Element:li
											The ability to reindex from one Elasticsearch index to another, either to change mappings or analysis, or to upgrade an index to a new major version.
										Element:li
											The ability to debug queries or aggregations by viewing the original document used at index time.
										Element:li
											Potentially in the future, the ability to repair index corruption automatically.

											If disk space is a concern, rather increase the
										Element:a

											instead of disabling the
										Element:code

											.
									Node:

										Element:p
										Element:strong
											The metrics use case
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:span
											use case is distinct from other time-based or logging use cases in that there are many small documents which consist only of numbers, dates, or keywords. There are no updates, no highlighting requests, and the data ages quickly so there is no need to reindex. Search requests typically use simple queries to filter the dataset by date or tags, and the results are returned as aggregations.
										Element:em
											metrics
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In this case, disabling the
										Element:code
											_source
											field will save space and reduce I/O. It is also advisable to disable the
										Element:a
											in the metrics case.

											Including / Excluding fields from

										Element:a

									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:p
											An expert-only feature is the ability to prune the contents of the
										Element:code
											_source
											field after the document has been indexed, but before the
										Element:code
											_source
											field is stored.

											Removing fields from the
										Element:code
											_source
											has similar downsides to disabling
										Element:code
											_source
											, especially the fact that you cannot reindex documents from one Elasticsearch index to another. Consider using
										Element:a
											source filtering
											instead.
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:p
											The

										Element:pre
											PUT logs { "mappings": { "event": { "_source": { "includes": [ "*.count", "meta.*" ], "excludes": [ "meta.description", "meta.other.*" ] } } } } PUT logs/event/1 { "requests": { "count": 10, "foo": "bar"
