										Element:p
											In previous versions of Elasticsearch, closing or deleting an index during a full snapshot would make the snapshot fail. In 5.0, the close/delete index request will fail instead. The behavior for partial snapshots remains unchanged: Closing or deleting an index during a partial snapshot is still possible. The snapshot result is then marked as partial.

											Warmers
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Thanks to several changes like doc values by default and disk-based norms, warmers are no longer useful. As a consequence, warmers and the warmer API have been removed: it is no longer possible to register queries that will run before a new IndexSearcher is published.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Don’t worry if you have warmers defined on your indices, they will simply be ignored when upgrading to 5.0.

											System CPU stats
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The recent CPU usage (as a percent) has been added to the OS stats reported under the node stats API and the cat nodes API. The breaking change here is that there is a new object in the
										Element:code
											os
											object in the node stats response. This object is called
										Element:code
											cpu
											and includes
										Element:code
											percent
											and
										Element:code
											load_average
											as fields. This moves the
										Element:code
											load_average
											field that was previously a top-level field in the
										Element:code
											os
											object to the
										Element:code
											cpu
											object. The format of the
										Element:code
											load_average
											field has changed to an object with fields
										Element:code
											1m
											,
										Element:code
											5m
											, and
										Element:code
											15m
											representing the one-minute, five-minute and fifteen-minute loads respectively. If any of these fields are not present, it indicates that the corresponding value is not available.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In the cat nodes API response, the
										Element:code
											cpu
											field is output by default. The previous
										Element:code
											load
											field has been removed and is replaced by
										Element:code
											load_1m
											,
										Element:code
											load_5m
											, and
										Element:code
											load_15m
											which represent the one-minute, five-minute and fifteen-minute loads respectively. The field will be null if the corresponding value is not available.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Finally, the API for
										Element:code
											org.elasticsearch.monitor.os.OsStats
											has changed. The
										Element:code
											getLoadAverage
											method has been removed. The value for this can now be obtained from
										Element:code
											OsStats.Cpu#getLoadAverage
											but it is no longer a double and is instead an object encapsulating the one-minute, five-minute and fifteen-minute load averages. Additionally, the recent CPU usage can be obtained from
										Element:code
											OsStats.Cpu#getPercent
											.

											Elasticsearch no longer allows indices to be created started with

										Element:span

										Element:code

											The

										Element:code
											true
											causing
										Element:code
											_flush
											calls to wait and block if another flush operation is currently running on the same shard. In turn, if
										Element:code
											wait_if_ongoing
											is set to
										Element:code
											false
											and another flush operation is already running the flush is skipped and the shards flush call will return immediately without any error. In previous versions
										Element:code
											flush_not_allowed
											exceptions where reported for each skipped shard.
