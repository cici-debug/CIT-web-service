											Based on the architecture of the available JDK/JRE (set through

											c:\elasticsearch-5.2.2\bin>elasticsearch-service install Installing service : "elasticsearch-service-x64" Using JAVA_HOME (64-bit): "c:\jvm\jdk1.8" The service 'elasticsearch-service-x64' has been installed.
									Node:

										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c

											While a JRE can be used for the Elasticsearch service, due to its use of a client VM (as opposed to a server JVM which offers better performance for long-running applications) its usage is discouraged and a warning will be issued.

											Upgrading (or downgrading) JVM versions does not require the service to be reinstalled. However, upgrading across JVM types (e.g. JRE versus SE) is not supported, and does require the service to be reinstalled.

											At its core,

											On Windows, the

											heap size
											can be configured as for any other Elasticsearch installation when running Elasticsearch from the command line, or when installing Elasticsearch as a service for the first time. To adjust the heap size for an already installed service, use the service manager:

											), which offers insight into the installed service, including its status, startup type, JVM, start and stop settings amongst other things. Simply invoking
										Element:code
											elasticsearch-service.bat manager
											from the command-line will open up the manager window:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:img
									Node:

											Most changes (like JVM settings) made through the manager GUI will require a restart of the service in order to take affect.

											This is very convenient because you don’t have to create any directories to start using Elasticsearch, and uninstalling Elasticsearch is as easy as removing the
