												Node:

														In some environments, it may make more sense to prepare a custom image containing your configuration. A

												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														FROM docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.2.2 ADD elasticsearch.yml /usr/share/elasticsearch/config/ USER root RUN chown elasticsearch:elasticsearch config/elasticsearch.yml USER elasticsearch
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														You could then build and try the image with something like:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														docker build --tag=elasticsearch-custom . docker run -ti -v /usr/share/elasticsearch/data elasticsearch-custom

														D. Override the image’s default
													Element:a
														CMD
													Element:a
														edit
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Options can be passed as command-line options to the Elasticsearch process by overriding the default command for the image. For example:
												Node:
												(type) c

									(layer)3
										Element:ol
										Element:li
										Element:p
											It is important to correctly set capabilities and ulimits via the Docker CLI. As seen earlier in the example
										Element:a
											docker-compose.yml
											, the following options are required:
										Element:pre
											--cap-add=IPC_LOCK --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 --ulimit nofile=65536:65536
										Element:li
										Element:p
											Ensure
										Element:code
											bootstrap.memory_lock
											is set to
										Element:code
											true
											as explained in "
										Element:a
											Disable swapping
											".
										Element:p
											This can be achieved through any of the
										Element:a
											configuration methods
											, e.g. by setting the appropriate environments variable with
										Element:code
											-e "bootstrap.memory_lock=true"
											.
										Element:li
											The image
										Element:a
											exposes
											TCP ports 9200 and 9300. For clusters it is recommended to randomize the published ports with
										Element:code
											--publish-all
											, unless you are pinning one container per host.
										Element:li
											Use the
										Element:code
											ES_JAVA_OPTS
											environment variable to set heap size, e.g. to use 16GB use
										Element:code
											-e ES_JAVA_OPTS="-Xms16g -Xmx16g"
											with
										Element:code
											docker run
											. It is also recommended to set a
										Element:a
											memory limit
											for the container.
										Element:li
											Pin your deployments to a specific version of the Elasticsearch Docker image, e.g.
										Element:code
											docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.2.2
											.
										Element:li
										Element:p
											Always use a volume bound on
										Element:code
											/usr/share/elasticsearch/data
											, as shown in the
										Element:a
											production example
											, for the following reasons:
										Element:ol
										Element:li
											The data of your elasticsearch node won’t be lost if the container is killed
										Element:li
											Elasticsearch is I/O sensitive and the Docker storage driver is not ideal for fast I/O
										Element:li
											It allows the use of advanced
										Element:a
											Docker volume plugins
										Element:li
											If you are using the devicemapper storage driver (default on at least RedHat (rpm) based distributions) make sure you are not using the default
										Element:code
											loop-lvm
											mode. Configure docker-engine to use
										Element:a
											direct-lvm
											instead.
										Element:li
											Consider centralizing your logs by using a different
										Element:a
											logging driver
											. Also note that the default json-file logging driver is not ideally suited for production use.
