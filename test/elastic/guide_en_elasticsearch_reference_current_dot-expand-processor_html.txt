						Node:

								Expands a field with dots into an object field. This processor allows fields with dots in the name to be accessible by other processors in the pipeline. Otherwise these <<accessing-data-in-pipelines,fields> can’t be accessed by any processor.

								The field that contains the field to expand. Only required if the field to expand is part another object field, because the

							Element:pre

						Node:

								For example the dot expand processor would turn this document:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "foo.bar" : "value" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								into:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "foo" : { "bar" : "value" } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If there is already a
							Element:code
								bar
								field nested under
							Element:code
								foo
								then this processor merges the the
							Element:code
								foo.bar
								field into it. If the field is a scalar value then it will turn that field into an array field.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For example, the following document:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "foo.bar" : "value2", "foo" : { "bar" : "value1" } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								is transformed by the
							Element:code
								dot_expander
								processor into:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "foo" : { "bar" : ["value1", "value2"] } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If any field outside of the leaf field conflicts with a pre-existing field of the same name, then that field needs to be renamed first.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Consider the following document:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "foo": "value1", "foo.bar": "value2" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Then the the
							Element:code
								foo
								needs to be renamed first before the
							Element:code
								dot_expander
								processor is applied. So in order for the
							Element:code
								foo.bar
								field to properly be expanded into the
							Element:code
								bar
								field under the
							Element:code
								foo
								field the following pipeline should be used:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "processors" : [ { "rename" : { "field" : "foo", "target_field" : "foo.bar"" } }, { "dot_expander": { "field": "foo.bar" } } ] }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The reason for this is that Ingest doesn’t know how to automatically cast a scalar field to an object field.
