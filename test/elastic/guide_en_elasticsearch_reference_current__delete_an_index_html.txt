							Element:h2
							Element:a
								Delete an Index
							Element:a
								edit
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Now let’s delete the index that we just created and then list all the indexes again:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								DELETE /customer?pretty GET /_cat/indices?v
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								And the response:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								health status index uuid pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Which means that the index was deleted successfully and we are now back to where we started with nothing in our cluster.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Before we move on, let’s take a closer look again at some of the API commands that we have learned so far:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								PUT /customer PUT /customer/external/1 { "name": "John Doe" } GET /customer/external/1 DELETE /customer
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If we study the above commands carefully, we can actually see a pattern of how we access data in Elasticsearch. That pattern can be summarized as follows:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								<REST Verb> /<Index>/<Type>/<ID>
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This REST access pattern is so pervasive throughout all the API commands that if you can simply remember it, you will have a good head start at mastering Elasticsearch.
