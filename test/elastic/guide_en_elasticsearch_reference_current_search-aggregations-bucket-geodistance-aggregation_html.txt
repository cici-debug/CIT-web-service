								Geo Distance Aggregation

						Node:

							Element:p
								A multi-bucket aggregation that works on
							Element:code
								geo_point
								fields and conceptually works very similar to the
							Element:a
								range
								aggregation. The user can define a point of origin and a set of distance range buckets. The aggregation evaluate the distance of each document value from the origin point and determines the buckets it belongs to based on the ranges (a document belongs to a bucket if the distance between the document and the origin falls within the distance range of the bucket).

								The specified field must be of type
							Element:code
								geo_point
								(which can only be set explicitly in the mappings). And it can also hold an array of
							Element:code
								geo_point
								fields, in which case all will be taken into account during aggregation. The origin point can accept all formats supported by the
							Element:a
								:
							Element:code

								Object format:
							Element:code
								{ "lat" : 52.3760, "lon" : 4.894 }
								- this is the safest format as it is the most explicit about the
							Element:code
								lat
								&
							Element:code
								lon
								values
							Element:li
								String format:
							Element:code
								"52.3760, 4.894"
								- where the first number is the
							Element:code
								lat
								and the second is the
							Element:code
								lon
							Element:li
								Array format:
							Element:code
								[4.894, 52.3760]
								- which is based on the
							Element:code
								GeoJson
								standard and where the first number is the
							Element:code
								lon
								and the second one is the
							Element:code
								lat

							Element:code

								There are three distance calculation modes:
							Element:code
								sloppy_arc
								(the default),
							Element:code
								arc
								(most accurate) and
							Element:code
								plane
								(fastest). The
							Element:code
								arc
								calculation is the most accurate one but also the more expensive one in terms of performance. The
							Element:code
								sloppy_arc
								is faster but less accurate. The
							Element:code
								plane
								is the fastest but least accurate distance function. Consider using
							Element:code
								plane
								when your search context is "narrow" and spans smaller geographical areas (like cities or even countries).
							Element:code
								plane
								may return higher error margins for searches across very large areas (e.g. cross continent search). The distance calculation type can be set using the
							Element:code
								distance_type
								parameter:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "aggs" : { "rings" : { "geo_distance" : { "field" : "location", "origin" : "52.3760, 4.894", "distance_type" : "plane", "ranges" : [ { "to" : 100 }, { "from" : 100, "to" : 300 }, { "from" : 300 } ] } } } }
