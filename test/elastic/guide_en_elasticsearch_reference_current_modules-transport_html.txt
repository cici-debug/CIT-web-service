						Node:

								The transport module is used for internal communication between nodes within the cluster. Each call that goes from one node to the other uses the transport module (for example, when an HTTP GET request is processed by one node, and should actually be processed by another node that holds the data).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The transport mechanism is completely asynchronous in nature, meaning that there is no blocking thread waiting for a response. The benefit of using asynchronous communication is first solving the
							Element:a
								C10k problem
								, as well as being the ideal solution for scatter (broadcast) / gather operations such as search in ElasticSearch.

											30s
											.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											transport.tcp.compress
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Set to

											to enable compression (LZF) between all nodes. Defaults to
										Element:code
											false
											.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											transport.ping_schedule
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Schedule a regular ping message to ensure that connections are kept alive. Defaults to
										Element:code
											5s
											in the transport client and
										Element:code
											-1
											(disabled) elsewhere.

												Node:

														Elasticsearch allows you to bind to multiple ports on different interfaces by the use of transport profiles. See this example configuration
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														transport.profiles.default.port: 9300-9400 transport.profiles.default.bind_host: 10.0.0.1 transport.profiles.client.port: 9500-9600 transport.profiles.client.bind_host: 192.168.0.1 transport.profiles.dmz.port: 9700-9800 transport.profiles.dmz.bind_host: 172.16.1.2
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The
													Element:code
														default
														profile is a special. It is used as fallback for any other profiles, if those do not have a specific configuration setting set. Note that the default profile is how other nodes in the cluster will connect to this node usually. In the future this feature will allow to enable node-to-node communication via multiple interfaces.

											The transport module has a dedicated tracer logger which, when activated, logs incoming and out going requests. The log can be dynamically activated by settings the level of the
										Element:code
											org.elasticsearch.transport.TransportService.tracer
											logger to
										Element:code
											TRACE
											:
									Node:
