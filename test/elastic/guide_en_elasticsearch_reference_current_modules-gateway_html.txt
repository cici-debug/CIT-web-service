						Node:

								The local gateway module stores the cluster state and shard data across full cluster restarts.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								The following _static_ settings, which must be set on every master node, control how long a freshly elected master should wait before it tries to recover the cluster state and the cluster's data:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:dl
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								gateway.expected_nodes
							Element:dd
								The number of (data or master) nodes that are expected to be in the cluster. Recovery of local shards will start as soon as the expected number of nodes have joined the cluster. Defaults to
							Element:code
								0
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								gateway.expected_master_nodes
							Element:dd
								The number of master nodes that are expected to be in the cluster. Recovery of local shards will start as soon as the expected number of master nodes have joined the cluster. Defaults to
							Element:code
								0
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								gateway.expected_data_nodes
							Element:dd
								The number of data nodes that are expected to be in the cluster. Recovery of local shards will start as soon as the expected number of data nodes have joined the cluster. Defaults to
							Element:code
								0
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								gateway.recover_after_time
							Element:dd
								If the expected number of nodes is not achieved, the recovery process waits for the configured amount of time before trying to recover regardless. Defaults to
							Element:code
								5m
								if one of the
							Element:code
								expected_nodes
								settings is configured.
						Node:

							Element:p
								Once the
							Element:code
								recover_after_time
								duration has timed out, recovery will start as long as the following conditions are met:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:dl
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								gateway.recover_after_nodes
							Element:dd
								Recover as long as this many data or master nodes have joined the cluster.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								gateway.recover_after_master_nodes
							Element:dd
								Recover as long as this many master nodes have joined the cluster.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
							Element:code
								gateway.recover_after_data_nodes
							Element:dd
								Recover as long as this many data nodes have joined the cluster.
