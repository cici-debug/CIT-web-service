										Element:p
											Numeric fields have been refactored to use a different data structure that performs better for range queries. However, since this data structure does not record document frequencies, numeric fields need to fall back to running queries in order to estimate the number of matching documents in the background set, which may incur a performance degradation.

											It is recommended to use
										Element:a
											fields instead, either directly or through a
										Element:code
											keyword
										Element:a
											multi-field
											if the numeric representation is still needed for sorting, range queries or numeric aggregations like
										Element:a

											Now that Elasticsearch supports
										Element:code
											ipv6
											,
										Element:code
											ip
											addresses are encoded in the index using a binary representation rather than a numeric representation. As a consequence, the output of
										Element:code
											ip_range
											aggregations does not give numeric values for
										Element:code
											from
											and
										Element:code
											to
											anymore.

											Fractional time values (e.g., 0.5s) are no longer supported. For example, this means when setting date histogram intervals "1.5h" will be rejected and should instead be input as "90m".
