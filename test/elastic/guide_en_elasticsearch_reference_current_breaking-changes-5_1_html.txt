												Node:

												(layer)4

														Alias names are now validated against almost the same set of rules that validate index names. The only difference is that aliases are allowed to have uppercase characters. That means that aliases may not:

												Node:

													Element:p
														Aliases created in versions before 5.1.0 are still supported but no new aliases can be added that violate those rules. Since modifying an alias in elasticsearch is removing it and recreating it atomically using the
													Element:code
														_aliases
														API, modifying aliases with invalid names is also no longer supported.

												Node:

													Element:p
														Local discovery has been removed; this discovery implementation was used internally in the tribe service and for tests that ran multiple nodes inside the same JVM. This means that setting
													Element:code
														discovery.type
														to
													Element:code
														local
														will fail on startup.

														Indices stats and node stats API unrecognized metrics
													Element:a
														edit
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The indices stats and node stats APIs allow querying Elasticsearch for a variety of metrics. Previous versions of Elasticsearch would silently accept unrecognized metrics (e.g., typos like "transprot"). In 5.1.0, this is no longer the case; unrecognized metrics will cause the request to fail. There is one exception to this which is the percolate metric which was removed in 5.0.0 but requests for these will only produce a warning in the 5.x series starting with 5.1.0 and will fail like any other unrecognized metric in 6.0.0.
