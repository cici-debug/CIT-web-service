								The pending cluster tasks API returns a list of any cluster-level changes (e.g. create index, update mapping, allocate or fail shard) which have not yet been executed.

								This API returns a list of any pending updates to the cluster state. These are distinct from the tasks reported by the
							Element:a
								Task Management API
								which include periodic tasks and tasks initiated by the user, such as node stats, search queries, or create index requests. However, if a user-initiated task such as a create index command causes a cluster state update, the activity of this task might be reported by both task api and pending cluster tasks API.

								$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/pending_tasks'
						Node:

							Element:p
								Usually this will return an empty list as cluster-level changes are usually fast. However if there are tasks queued up, the output will look something like this:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "tasks": [ { "insert_order": 101, "priority": "URGENT", "source": "create-index [foo_9], cause [api]", "time_in_queue_millis": 86, "time_in_queue": "86ms" }, { "insert_order": 46, "priority": "HIGH", "source": "shard-started ([foo_2][1], node[tMTocMvQQgGCkj7QDHl3OA], [P], s[INITIALIZING]), reason [after recovery from shard_store]", "time_in_queue_millis": 842, "time_in_queue": "842ms" }, { "insert_order": 45, "priority": "HIGH", "source": "shard-started ([foo_2][0], node[tMTocMvQQgGCkj7QDHl3OA], [P], s[INITIALIZING]), reason [after recovery from shard_store]", "time_in_queue_millis": 858, "time_in_queue": "858ms" } ] }
