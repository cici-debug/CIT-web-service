								The purpose of the cluster allocation explain API is to provide explanations for shard allocations in the cluster. For unassigned shards, the explain API provides an explanation for why the shard is unassigned. For assigned shards, the explain API provides an explanation for why the shard is remaining on its current node and has not moved or rebalanced to another node. This API can be very useful when attempting to diagnose why a shard is unassigned or why a shard continues to remain on its current node when you might expect otherwise.

											To explain the allocation of a shard, issue a request:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/allocation/explain' -d '{ "index": "myindex", "shard": 0, "primary": true }'
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Specify the
										Element:code
											index
											and
										Element:code
											shard
											id of the shard you would like an explanation for, as well as the
										Element:code
											primary
											flag to indicate whether to explain the primary shard for the given shard id or one of its replica shards. These three request parameters are required.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You may also specify an optional
										Element:code
											current_node
											request parameter to only explain a shard that is currently located on
										Element:code
											current_node
											. The
										Element:code
											current_node
											can be specified as either the node id or node name.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/allocation/explain' -d '{ "index": "myindex", "shard": 0, "primary": false, "current_node": "nodeA"

											The default value for

											include_yes_decisions
											is
										Element:code
											false
											, which will only include the

											no
											decisions in the response. This is generally what you would want, as the
										Element:code
											no
											decisions indicate why a shard is unassigned or cannot be moved, and including all decisions include the
										Element:code
											yes
											ones adds a lot of verbosity to the API’s response output.
