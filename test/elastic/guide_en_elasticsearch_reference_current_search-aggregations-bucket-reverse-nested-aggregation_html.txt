								Reverse nested Aggregation

						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A special single bucket aggregation that enables aggregating on parent docs from nested documents. Effectively this aggregation can break out of the nested block structure and link to other nested structures or the root document, which allows nesting other aggregations that aren’t part of the nested object in a nested aggregation.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								reverse_nested
								aggregation must be defined inside a
							Element:code
								nested
								aggregation.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Options:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:code
								path
								- Which defines to what nested object field should be joined back. The default is empty, which means that it joins back to the root / main document level. The path cannot contain a reference to a nested object field that falls outside the
							Element:code
								nested
								aggregation’s nested structure a
							Element:code
								reverse_nested
								is in.

								For example, lets say we have an index for a ticket system with issues and comments. The comments are inlined into the issue documents as nested documents. The mapping could look like:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ ... "issue" : { "properties" : { "tags" : { "type" : "text" } "comments" : {
							Element:a
							Element:span
								"type" : "nested" "properties" : { "username" : { "type" : "keyword" }, "comment" : { "type" : "text" } } } } } }
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:table
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:a
							Element:span
							Element:img
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								comments
								is an array that holds nested documents under the
							Element:code
								issue
								object.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The following aggregations will return the top commenters' username that have commented and per top commenter the top tags of the issues the user has commented on:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "query": { "match": { "name": "led tv" } }, "aggs": { "comments": { "nested": { "path": "comments" }, "aggs": { "top_usernames": { "terms": { "field": "comments.username" }, "aggs": { "comment_to_issue": { "reverse_nested": {},
							Element:a
							Element:span
								"aggs": { "top_tags_per_comment": { "terms": { "field": "tags" } } } } } } } } } }
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								As you can see above, the
							Element:code
								reverse_nested
								aggregation is put in to a
							Element:code
								nested
								aggregation as this is the only place in the dsl where the
							Element:code
								reversed_nested
								aggregation can be used. Its sole purpose is to join back to a parent doc higher up in the nested structure.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:table
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:a
							Element:span
							Element:img
							Element:td
							Element:p
								A
							Element:code
								reverse_nested
								aggregation that joins back to the root / main document level, because no
							Element:code
								path
								has been defined. Via the
							Element:code
								path
								option the
							Element:code
								reverse_nested
								aggregation can join back to a different level, if multiple layered nested object types have been defined in the mapping
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Possible response snippet:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "aggregations": { "comments": { "top_usernames": { "buckets": [ { "key": "username_1", "doc_count": 12, "comment_to_issue": { "top_tags_per_comment": { "buckets": [ { "key": "tag1", "doc_count": 9 }, ... ] } } }, ... ] } } } }
