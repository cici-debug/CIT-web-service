										Element:p
											Previously percolators were activated in real-time, i.e. as soon as they were indexed. Now, changes to the
										Element:code
											percolate
											query are visible in near-real time, as soon as the index has been refreshed. This change was required because, in indices created from 5.0 onwards, the terms used in a percolator query are automatically indexed to allow for more efficient query selection during percolation.

										Element:p
											Percolator and multi percolate APIs have been deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. These APIs have been replaced by the
										Element:code
											percolate
											query that can be used in the search and multi search APIs.

										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											.percolator
											type can no longer be used to index percolator queries.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Instead a
										Element:a
											percolator field type
											must be configured prior to indexing percolator queries.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Indices with a
										Element:code
											.percolator
											type created on a version before 5.0.0 can still be used, but new indices no longer accept the
										Element:code
											.percolator
											type.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											However it is strongly recommended to reindex any indices containing percolator queries created prior upgrading to Elasticsearch 5. By doing this the
										Element:code
											percolate
											query utilize the extracted terms the
										Element:code
											percolator
											field type extracted from the percolator queries and potentially execute many times faster.

									Node:

										Element:p
											The

											percolate
											query no longer modifies the mappings. Before the percolate API could be used to dynamically introduce new fields to the mappings based on the fields in the document being percolated. This no longer works, because these unmapped fields are not persisted in the mapping.

											Documents with the

									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Percolator queries that contain scripts (For example:
										Element:code
											script
											query or a
										Element:code
											function_score
											query script function) that have no explicit language specified will use the Painless scripting language from version 5.0 and up.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Scripts with no explicit language set in percolator queries stored in indices created prior to version 5.0 will use the language that has been configured in the
										Element:code
											script.legacy.default_lang
											setting. This setting defaults to the Groovy scripting language, which was the default for versions prior to 5.0. If your default scripting language was different then set the
										Element:code
											script.legacy.default_lang
											setting to the language you used before.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In order to make use of the new
										Element:code
											percolator
											field type all percolator queries should be reindexed into a new index. When reindexing percolator queries with scripts that have no explicit language defined into a new index, one of the following two things should be done in order to make the scripts work: * (Recommended approach) While reindexing the percolator documents, migrate the scripts to the Painless scripting language. * or add
										Element:code
											lang
											parameter on the script and set it the language these scripts were written in.

											The percolator is no longer part of the core elasticsearch dependency. It has moved to the percolator module. Therefor when using the percolator feature from the Java client the new percolator module should also be on the classpath. Also the transport client should load the percolator module as plugin:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											TransportClient transportClient = TransportClient.builder() .settings(Settings.builder().put("node.name", "node")) .addPlugin(PercolatorPlugin.class) .build(); transportClient.addTransportAddress( new InetSocketTransportAddress(new InetSocketAddress(InetAddresses.forString("127.0.0.1"), 9300)) );
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The percolator and multi percolate related methods from the
										Element:code
											Client
											interface have been removed. These APIs have been deprecated and it is recommended to use the
										Element:code
											percolate
											query in either the search or multi search APIs. However the percolate and multi percolate APIs can still be used from the Java client.
									Node:
									(type) c
