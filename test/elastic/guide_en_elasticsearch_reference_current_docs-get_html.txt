								Get API
							Element:a

						Node:

								The get API allows to get a typed JSON document from the index based on its id. The following example gets a JSON document from an index called twitter, under a type called tweet, with id valued 0:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET twitter/tweet/0
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The result of the above get operation is:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								{ "_index" : "twitter", "_type" : "tweet", "_id" : "0", "_version" : 1, "found": true, "_source" : { "user" : "kimchy", "date" : "2009-11-15T14:12:12", "likes": 0, "message" : "trying out Elasticsearch" } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The above result includes the
							Element:code
								_index
								,
							Element:code
								_type
								,
							Element:code
								_id
								and
							Element:code
								_version
								of the document we wish to retrieve, including the actual
							Element:code
								_source
								of the document if it could be found (as indicated by the
							Element:code
								found
								field in the response).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The API also allows to check for the existence of a document using
							Element:code
								HEAD
								, for example:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								HEAD twitter/tweet/0

									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											By default, the get API is realtime, and is not affected by the refresh rate of the index (when data will become visible for search). If a document has been updated but is not yet refreshed, the get API will issue a refresh call in-place to make the document visible. This will also make other documents changed since the last refresh visible. In order to disable realtime GET, one can set the
										Element:code
											realtime
											parameter to
										Element:code
											false
											.

											Source filtering
										Element:a

									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											By default, the get operation returns the contents of the
										Element:code
											_source
											field unless you have used the
										Element:code
											stored_fields
											parameter or if the
										Element:code
											_source
											field is disabled. You can turn off
										Element:code
											_source
											retrieval by using the
										Element:code
											_source
											parameter:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET twitter/tweet/0?_source=false
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you only need one or two fields from the complete
										Element:code
											_source
											, you can use the
										Element:code
											_source_include
											&
										Element:code
											_source_exclude
											parameters to include or filter out that parts you need. This can be especially helpful with large documents where partial retrieval can save on network overhead. Both parameters take a comma separated list of fields or wildcard expressions. Example:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET twitter/tweet/0?_source_include=*.id&_source_exclude=entities
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you only want to specify includes, you can use a shorter notation:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET twitter/tweet/0?_source=*.id,retweeted
						Node:
						(type) c

											Stored Fields
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The get operation allows specifying a set of stored fields that will be returned by passing the
										Element:code
											stored_fields
											parameter. If the requested fields are not stored, they will be ignored. Consider for instance the following mapping:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											PUT twitter { "mappings": { "tweet": { "properties": { "counter": { "type": "integer", "store": false }, "tags": { "type": "keyword", "store": true } } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Now we can add a document:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											PUT twitter/tweet/1 { "counter" : 1, "tags" : ["red"] }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ol
										Element:li
											and try to retrieve it:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET twitter/tweet/1?stored_fields=tags,counter
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The result of the above get operation is:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "_index": "twitter", "_type": "tweet", "_id": "1", "_version": 1, "found": true, "fields": { "tags": [ "red" ] } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Field values fetched from the document it self are always returned as an array. Since the
										Element:code
											counter
											field is not stored the get request simply ignores it when trying to get the
										Element:code
											stored_fields.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											It is also possible to retrieve metadata fields like
										Element:code
											_routing
											and
										Element:code
											_parent
											fields:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											PUT twitter/tweet/2?routing=user1 { "counter" : 1, "tags" : ["white"] }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET twitter/tweet/2?routing=user1&stored_fields=tags,counter
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The result of the above get operation is:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "_index": "twitter", "_type": "tweet", "_id": "2", "_version": 1, "_routing": "user1", "found": true, "fields": { "tags": [ "white" ] } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Also only leaf fields can be returned via the
										Element:code
											stored_field
											option. So object fields can’t be returned and such requests will fail.

									Node:

											If no refresh occurred between indexing and refresh, GET will access the transaction log to fetch the document. However, some fields are generated only when indexing. If you try to access a field that is only generated when indexing, you will get an exception (default). You can choose to ignore field that are generated if the transaction log is accessed by setting
										Element:code
											ignore_errors_on_generated_fields=true
											.

											Getting the _source directly
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Use the
										Element:code
											/{index}/{type}/{id}/_source
											endpoint to get just the
										Element:code
											_source
											field of the document, without any additional content around it. For example:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET twitter/tweet/1/_source
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You can also use the same source filtering parameters to control which parts of the
										Element:code
											_source
											will be returned:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET twitter/tweet/1/_source?_source_include=*.id&_source_exclude=entities'
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Note, there is also a HEAD variant for the _source endpoint to efficiently test for document _source existence. An existing document will not have a _source if it is disabled in the
										Element:a
											mapping
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											HEAD twitter/tweet/1/_source

											Routing
										Element:a
											edit
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When indexing using the ability to control the routing, in order to get a document, the routing value should also be provided. For example:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET twitter/tweet/2?routing=user1
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The above will get a tweet with id 2, but will be routed based on the user. Note, issuing a get without the correct routing, will cause the document not to be fetched.

											Controls a

											of which shard replicas to execute the get request on. By default, the operation is randomized between the shard replicas.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3

											The
										Element:code

											can be set to:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:dl
										Element:dt
										Element:span
										Element:code
											_primary
										Element:dd
											The operation will go and be executed only on the primary shards.
										Element:dt
										Element:span
										Element:code
											_local
										Element:dd
											The operation will prefer to be executed on a local allocated shard if possible.
										Element:dt
										Element:span
											Custom (string) value
										Element:dd
											A custom value will be used to guarantee that the same shards will be used for the same custom value. This can help with "jumping values" when hitting different shards in different refresh states. A sample value can be something like the web session id, or the user name.

											The

											refresh
											parameter can be set to
										Element:code
											true
											in order to refresh the relevant shard before the get operation and make it searchable. Setting it to
										Element:code
											true
											should be done after careful thought and verification that this does not cause a heavy load on the system (and slows down indexing).

											The get operation gets hashed into a specific shard id. It then gets redirected to one of the replicas within that shard id and returns the result. The replicas are the primary shard and its replicas within that shard id group. This means that the more replicas we will have, the better GET scaling we will have.

											Versioning support

									Node:

										Element:p
											You can use the
										Element:code
											version
											parameter to retrieve the document only if its current version is equal to the specified one. This behavior is the same for all version types with the exception of version type
										Element:code
											FORCE
											which always retrieves the document. Note that
										Element:code
											FORCE
											version type is deprecated.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Internally, Elasticsearch has marked the old document as deleted and added an entirely new document. The old version of the document doesn’t disappear immediately, although you won’t be able to access it. Elasticsearch cleans up deleted documents in the background as you continue to index more data.
