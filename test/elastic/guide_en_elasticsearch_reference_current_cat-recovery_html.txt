								The
							Element:code
								recovery
								command is a view of index shard recoveries, both on-going and previously completed. It is a more compact view of the JSON
							Element:a
								recovery
								API.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A recovery event occurs anytime an index shard moves to a different node in the cluster. This can happen during a snapshot recovery, a change in replication level, node failure, or on node startup. This last type is called a local store recovery and is the normal way for shards to be loaded from disk when a node starts up.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								As an example, here is what the recovery state of a cluster may look like when there are no shards in transit from one node to another:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre

								In the above case, the source and target nodes are the same because the recovery type was store, i.e. they were read from local storage on node start.

								Now let’s see what a live recovery looks like. By increasing the replica count of our index and bringing another node online to host the replicas, we can see what a live shard recovery looks like.

								We can see in the above listing that our 3 initial shards are in various stages of being replicated from one node to another. Notice that the recovery type is shown as
							Element:code
								replica
								. The files and bytes copied are real-time measurements.

								Finally, let’s see what a snapshot recovery looks like. Assuming I have previously made a backup of my index, I can restore it using the
							Element:a
								snapshot and restore
								API.
