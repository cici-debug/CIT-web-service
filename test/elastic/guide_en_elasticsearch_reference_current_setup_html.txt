								Elasticsearch is built using Java, and requires at least
							Element:a
								Java 8
								in order to run. Only Oracle’s Java and the OpenJDK are supported. The same JVM version should be used on all Elasticsearch nodes and clients.
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								We recommend installing Java version
							Element:span
								. Elasticsearch will refuse to start if a known-bad version of Java is used.
							Element:strong
								1.8.0_121 or later
						Node:

								The version of Java that Elasticsearch will use can be configured by setting the
							Element:code
								JAVA_HOME
								environment variable.

								Elasticsearch ships with default configuration for running Elasticsearch on 64-bit server JVMs. If you are using a 32-bit client JVM, you must remove
							Element:code
								-server
								from
							Element:a
								jvm.options
								and if you are using any 32-bit JVM you should reconfigure the thread stack size from
							Element:code
								-Xss1m
								to
							Element:code
								-Xss320k
								.
