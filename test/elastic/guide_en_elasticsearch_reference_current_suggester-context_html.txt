						Node:

								The completion suggester considers all documents in the index, but it is often desirable to serve suggestions filtered and/or boosted by some criteria. For example, you want to suggest song titles filtered by certain artists or you want to boost song titles based on their genre.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To achieve suggestion filtering and/or boosting, you can add context mappings while configuring a completion field. You can define multiple context mappings for a completion field. Every context mapping has a unique name and a type. There are two types:
							Element:code
								category
								and
							Element:code
								geo
								. Context mappings are configured under the
							Element:code
								contexts
								parameter in the field mapping.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The following defines types, each with two context mappings for a completion field:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre

												Node:

														The mappings are set up like the

												Node:
