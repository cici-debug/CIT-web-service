														Scoring capabilities

												Node:

													Element:p
														The
													Element:code
														has_parent
														also has scoring support. The default is
													Element:code
														false
														which ignores the score from the parent document. The score is in this case equal to the boost on the
													Element:code
														has_parent
														query (Defaults to 1). If the score is set to
													Element:code
														true
														, then the score of the matching parent document is aggregated into the child documents belonging to the matching parent document. The score mode can be specified with the
													Element:code
														score
														field inside the
													Element:code
														has_parent
														query:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														GET /_search { "query": { "has_parent" : { "parent_type" : "blog", "score" : true, "query" : { "term" : { "tag" : "something" } } } } }

														When set to
													Element:code
														true
														the
													Element:code
														ignore_unmapped
														option will ignore an unmapped
													Element:code
														type
														and will not match any documents for this query. This can be useful when querying multiple indexes which might have different mappings. When set to
													Element:code
														false
														(the default value) the query will throw an exception if the
													Element:code
														type
														is not mapped.
