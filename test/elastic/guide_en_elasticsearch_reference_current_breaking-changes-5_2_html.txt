													Element:p
														Elasticsearch has attempted to install a system call filter since version 2.1.0. On some systems, installing this system call filter could fail. Previous versions of Elasticsearch would log a warning, but would otherwise continue executing potentially leaving the end-user unaware of this situation. Starting in Elasticsearch 5.2.0, there is now a
													Element:a
														bootstrap check
														for success of installing the system call filter. If you encounter an issue starting Elasticsearch due to this bootstrap check, you need to either fix your configuration so that the system call filter can be installed, or
													Element:span
														disable the
													Element:strong
														at your own risk
													Element:a
														system call filter check
														.

													Element:p
														Elasticsearch has attempted to install a system call filter since version 2.1.0. These are enabled by default and could be disabled via
													Element:code
														bootstrap.seccomp
														. The naming of this setting is poor since seccomp is specific to Linux but Elasticsearch attempts to install a system call filter on various operating systems. Starting in Elasticsearch 5.2.0, this setting has been renamed to
													Element:code
														bootstrap.system_call_filter
														. The previous setting is still support but will be removed in Elasticsearch 6.0.0.
