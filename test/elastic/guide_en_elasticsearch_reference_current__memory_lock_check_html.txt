								When the JVM does a major garbage collection it touches every page of the heap. If any of those pages are swapped out to disk they will have to be swapped back in to memory. That causes lots of disk thrashing that Elasticsearch would much rather use to service requests. There are several ways to configure a system to disallow swapping. One way is by requesting the JVM to lock the heap in memory through
							Element:code
								mlockall
								(Unix) or virtual lock (Windows). This is done via the Elasticsearch setting
							Element:a
								. However, there are cases where this setting can be passed to Elasticsearch but Elasticsearch is not able to lock the heap (e.g., if the
							Element:code
								bootstrap.memory_lock
							Element:code
								elasticsearch
								user does not have
							Element:code
								memlock unlimited
								). The memory lock check verifies that
							Element:span
								the
							Element:strong
								if
							Element:code
								bootstrap.memory_lock
								setting is enabled, that the JVM was successfully able to lock the heap. To pass the memory lock check, you might have to configure
							Element:a
								.
