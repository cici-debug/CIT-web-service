											The
										Element:code
											aggregations
											section contains detailed timing of the aggregation tree executed by a particular shard. The overall structure of this aggregation tree will resemble your original Elasticsearch request. Let’s consider the following example aggregations request:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET /house-prices/_search { "profile": true, "size": 0, "aggs": { "property_type": { "terms": { "field": "propertyType" }, "aggs": { "avg_price": { "avg": { "field": "price" } } } } } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Which yields the following aggregation profile output
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											"aggregations": [ { "type": "org.elasticsearch.search.aggregations.bucket.terms.GlobalOrdinalsStringTermsAggregator", "description": "property_type", "time": "4280.456978ms", "breakdown": { "reduce": 0, "reduce_count": 0, "build_aggregation": 49765, "build_aggregation_count": 300, "initialise": 52785, "initialize_count": 300, "collect": 3155490036, "collect_count": 1800 }, "children": [ { "type": "org.elasticsearch.search.aggregations.metrics.avg.AvgAggregator", "description": "avg_price", "time": "1124.864392ms", "breakdown": { "reduce": 0, "reduce_count": 0, "build_aggregation": 1394, "build_aggregation_count": 150, "initialise": 2883, "initialize_count": 150, "collect": 1124860115, "collect_count": 900 } } ] } ]
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											From the profile structure we can see our
										Element:code
											property_type
											terms aggregation which is internally represented by the
										Element:code
											GlobalOrdinalsStringTermsAggregator
											class and the sub aggregator
										Element:code
											avg_price
											which is internally represented by the
										Element:code
											AvgAggregator
											class. The
										Element:code
											type
											field displays the class used internally to represent the aggregation. The
										Element:code
											description
											field displays the name of the aggregation.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											"time"
											field shows that it took ~4 seconds for the entire aggregation to execute. The recorded time is inclusive of all children.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											"breakdown"
											field will give detailed stats about how the time was spent, we’ll look at that in a moment. Finally, the
										Element:code
											"children"
											array lists any sub-aggregations that may be present. Because we have an
										Element:code
											avg_price
											aggregation as a sub-aggregation to the
										Element:code
											property_type
											aggregation we see it listed as a child of the
										Element:code
											property_type
											aggregation. the two aggregation outputs have identical information (type, time, breakdown, etc). Children are allowed to have their own children.

														The
													Element:code
														"breakdown"
														component lists detailed timing statistics about low-level Lucene execution:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														"breakdown": { "reduce": 0, "reduce_count": 0, "build_aggregation": 49765, "build_aggregation_count": 300, "initialise": 52785, "initialize_count": 300, "collect": 3155490036, "collect_count": 1800 }
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Timings are listed in wall-clock nanoseconds and are not normalized at all. All caveats about the overall
													Element:code
														time
														apply here. The intention of the breakdown is to give you a feel for A) what machinery in Elasticsearch is actually eating time, and B) the magnitude of differences in times between the various components. Like the overall time, the breakdown is inclusive of all children times.
												Node:
												(type) c

													Element:td
													Element:p
														This is not currently used and will always report

													Element:tr

													Element:code

														Records the number of invocations of the particular method. For example,
