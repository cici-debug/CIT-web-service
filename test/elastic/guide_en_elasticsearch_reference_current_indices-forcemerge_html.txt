								The force merge API allows to force merging of one or more indices through an API. The merge relates to the number of segments a Lucene index holds within each shard. The force merge operation allows to reduce the number of segments by merging them.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This call will block until the merge is complete. If the http connection is lost, the request will continue in the background, and any new requests will block until the previous force merge is complete.

											The force merge API accepts the following request parameters:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:colgroup
										Element:col
										Element:col
										Element:tbody
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											max_num_segments
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The number of segments to merge to. To fully merge the index, set it to
										Element:code
											1
											. Defaults to simply checking if a merge needs to execute, and if so, executes it.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											only_expunge_deletes
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Should the merge process only expunge segments with deletes in it. In Lucene, a document is not deleted from a segment, just marked as deleted. During a merge process of segments, a new segment is created that does not have those deletes. This flag allows to only merge segments that have deletes. Defaults to
										Element:code
											false
											. Note that this won’t override the
										Element:code
											index.merge.policy.expunge_deletes_allowed
											threshold.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											flush
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Should a flush be performed after the forced merge. Defaults to
										Element:code
											true
											.
