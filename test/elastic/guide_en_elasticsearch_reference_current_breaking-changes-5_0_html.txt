											Elasticsearch 5.0 can read indices created in version 2.0 or above. An Elasticsearch 5.0 node will not start in the presence of indices created in a version of Elasticsearch before 2.0.

									Node:

										Element:p
											Indices created in Elasticsearch 1.x or before will need to be reindexed with Elasticsearch 2.x or 5.x in order to be readable by Elasticsearch 5.x. It is not sufficient to use the
										Element:code
											upgrade
											API. See
										Element:a
											Reindex to upgrade
											for more details.

										Element:p
											The first time Elasticsearch 5.0 starts, it will automatically rename index folders to use the index UUID instead of the index name. If you are using
										Element:a
											shadow replicas
											with shared data folders, first start a single node with access to all data folders, and let it rename all index folders before starting other nodes in the cluster.
