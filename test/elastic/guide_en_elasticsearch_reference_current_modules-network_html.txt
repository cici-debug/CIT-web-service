								Elasticsearch binds to localhost only by default. This is sufficient for you to run a local development server (or even a development cluster, if you start multiple nodes on the same machine), but you will need to configure some
							Element:a
								basic network settings
								in order to run a real production cluster across multiple servers.

											The node will bind to this hostname or IP address and
										Element:span
											(advertise) this host to other nodes in the cluster. Accepts an IP address, hostname, a
										Element:em
											publish
										Element:a
											special value

										Element:dt

										Element:code
											discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts
										Element:dd
										Element:p
											In order to join a cluster, a node needs to know the hostname or IP address of at least some of the other nodes in the cluster. This setting provides the initial list of other nodes that this node will try to contact. Accepts IP addresses or hostnames. If a hostname lookup resolves to multiple IP addresses then each IP address will be used for discovery.
										Element:a
											Round robin DNS
											— returning a different IP from a list on each lookup — can be used for discovery; non- existent IP addresses will throw exceptions and cause another DNS lookup on the next round of pinging (subject to JVM DNS caching).
										Element:p

										Element:code
											["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]

										Element:dt

										Element:code
											9200-9300

											The
										Element:code
											network.host
											setting explained in
										Element:a
											Commonly used network settings
											is a shortcut which sets the
										Element:span
											and the
										Element:em
											bind host
										Element:span
											at the same time. In advanced used cases, such as when running behind a proxy server, you may need to set these settings to different values:
										Element:em
											publish host
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:dl
										Element:dt
										Element:span
										Element:code
											network.bind_host
										Element:dd
											This specifies which network interface(s) a node should bind to in order to listen for incoming requests. A node can bind to multiple interfaces, e.g. two network cards, or a site-local address and a local address. Defaults to
										Element:code
											network.host
											.
										Element:dt
										Element:span
										Element:code
											network.publish_host
										Element:dd
											The publish host is the single interface that the node advertises to other nodes in the cluster, so that those nodes can connect to it. Currently an elasticsearch node may be bound to multiple addresses, but only publishes one. If not specified, this defaults to the “best” address from
										Element:code
											network.host
											, sorted by IPv4/IPv6 stack preference, then by reachability.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Both of the above settings can be configured just like
										Element:code
											network.host
											— they accept IP addresses, host names, and
										Element:a
											special values
											.

										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											network.tcp.keep_alive

										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											network.tcp.reuse_address

										Element:p

											true
											on non-windows machines.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											network.tcp.send_buffer_size
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The size of the TCP send buffer (specified with

											size units
											). By default not explicitly set.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:code
											network.tcp.receive_buffer_size
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The size of the TCP receive buffer (specified with

										Element:dd
											Exposes the JSON-over-HTTP interface used by all clients other than the Java clients. See the

											HTTP module
											for more information.
