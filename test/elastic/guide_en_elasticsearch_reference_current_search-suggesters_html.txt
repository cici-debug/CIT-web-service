								Several suggestions can be specified per request. Each suggestion is identified with an arbitrary name. In the example below two suggestions are requested. Both
							Element:code
								my-suggest-1
								and
							Element:code
								my-suggest-2
								suggestions use the
							Element:code
								term
								suggester, but have a different
							Element:code
								text
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								POST _search { "suggest": { "my-suggest-1" : { "text" : "tring out Elasticsearch", "term" : { "field" : "message" } }, "my-suggest-2" : { "text" : "kmichy", "term" : { "field" : "user" } } } }

								The below suggest response example includes the suggestion response for
							Element:code
								my-suggest-1
								and
							Element:code
								my-suggest-2
								. Each suggestion part contains entries. Each entry is effectively a token from the suggest text and contains the suggestion entry text, the original start offset and length in the suggest text and if found an arbitrary number of options.
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:pre
								{ "_shards": ... "hits": ... "took": 2, "timed_out": false, "suggest": { "my-suggest-1": [ { "text": "tring", "offset": 0, "length": 5, "options": [ {"text": "trying", "score": 0.8, "freq": 1 } ] }, { "text": "out", "offset": 6, "length": 3, "options": [] }, { "text": "elasticsearch", "offset": 10, "length": 13, "options": [] } ], "my-suggest-2": ... } }
						Node:

							Element:p
								Each options array contains an option object that includes the suggested text, its document frequency and score compared to the suggest entry text. The meaning of the score depends on the used suggester. The term suggester’s score is based on the edit distance.

											To avoid repetition of the suggest text, it is possible to define a global text. In the example below the suggest text is defined globally and applies to the
										Element:code
											my-suggest-1
											and
										Element:code
											my-suggest-2
											suggestions.
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:pre

									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The suggest text can in the above example also be specified as suggestion specific option. The suggest text specified on suggestion level override the suggest text on the global level.
