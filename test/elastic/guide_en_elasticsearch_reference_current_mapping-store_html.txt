								By default, field values are

								stored
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Usually this doesn’t matter. The field value is already part of the
							Element:a
								, which is stored by default. If you only want to retrieve the value of a single field or of a few fields, instead of the whole
							Element:code
								_source
								field
							Element:code
								_source
								, then this can be achieved with
							Element:a
								source filtering
								.
						Node:

								In certain situations it can make sense to
							Element:code
								store
								a field. For instance, if you have a document with a
							Element:code
								title
								, a
							Element:code
								date
								, and a very large
							Element:code
								content
								field, you may want to retrieve just the
							Element:code
								title
								and the
							Element:code
								date
								without having to extract those fields from a large
							Element:code
								_source
								field:
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:pre
								PUT my_index { "mappings": { "my_type": { "properties": { "title": { "type": "text", "store": true
							Element:a

								}, "content": { "type": "text" } } } } } PUT my_index/my_type/1 { "title": "Some short title", "date": "2015-01-01", "content": "A very long content field..." } GET my_index/_search { "stored_fields": [ "title", "date" ]

							Element:a

							Element:a
							Element:span
							Element:img
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The

								title
								and
							Element:code
								date
								fields are stored.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:a
							Element:span
							Element:img
							Element:td
							Element:p
								This request will retrieve the values of the
							Element:code

								and

								fields.

											Stored fields returned as arrays
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											For consistency, stored fields are always returned as an
										Element:span
											because there is no way of knowing if the original field value was a single value, multiple values, or an empty array.
										Element:em
											array
									Node:
									(type) c

											If you need the original value, you should retrieve it from the

											_source
											field instead.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Another situation where it can make sense to make a field stored is for those that don’t appear in the
