								Match Phrase Prefix Query

						Node:

							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								match_phrase_prefix
								is the same as
							Element:code
								match_phrase
								, except that it allows for prefix matches on the last term in the text. For example:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET /_search { "query": { "match_phrase_prefix" : { "message" : "quick brown f" } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								It accepts the same parameters as the phrase type. In addition, it also accepts a
							Element:code
								max_expansions
								parameter (default
							Element:code
								50
								) that can control to how many prefixes the last term will be expanded. It is highly recommended to set it to an acceptable value to control the execution time of the query. For example:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET /_search { "query": { "match_phrase_prefix" : { "message" : { "query" : "quick brown f", "max_expansions" : 10 } } } }

								The
							Element:code
								match_phrase_prefix
								query is a poor-man’s autocomplete. It is very easy to use, which let’s you get started quickly with
							Element:span
								but it’s results, which usually are good enough, can sometimes be confusing.
							Element:em
								search-as-you-type
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								Consider the query string
							Element:code
								quick brown f
								. This query works by creating a phrase query out of
							Element:code
								quick
								and
							Element:code
								brown
								(i.e. the term
							Element:code
								quick
								must exist and must be followed by the term
							Element:code
								brown
								). Then it looks at the sorted term dictionary to find the first 50 terms that begin with
							Element:code
								f
								, and adds these terms to the phrase query.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The problem is that the first 50 terms may not include the term
							Element:code
								fox
								so the phase
							Element:code
								quick brown fox
								will not be found. This usually isn’t a problem as the user will continue to type more letters until the word they are looking for appears.
