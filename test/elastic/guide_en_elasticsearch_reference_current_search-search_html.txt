								The search API allows you to execute a search query and get back search hits that match the query. The query can either be provided using a simple
							Element:a
								query string as a parameter
								, or using a
							Element:a
								request body
								.

											All search APIs can be applied across multiple types within an index, and across multiple indices with support for the
										Element:a
											multi index syntax
											. For example, we can search on all documents across all types within the twitter index:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET /twitter/_search?q=user:kimchy
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											We can also search within specific types:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET /twitter/tweet,user/_search?q=user:kimchy
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											We can also search all tweets with a certain tag across several indices (for example, when each user has his own index):
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET /kimchy,elasticsearch/tweet/_search?q=tag:wow
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Or we can search all tweets across all available indices using
										Element:code
											_all
											placeholder:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET /_all/tweet/_search?q=tag:wow
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Or even search across all indices and all types:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											GET /_search?q=tag:wow
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											By default elasticsearch rejects search requests that would query more than 1000 shards. The reason is that such large numbers of shards make the job of the coordinating node very CPU and memory intensive. It is usually a better idea to organize data in such a way that there are fewer larger shards. In case you would like to bypass this limit, which is discouraged, you can update the
										Element:code
											action.search.shard_count.limit
											cluster setting to a greater value.
