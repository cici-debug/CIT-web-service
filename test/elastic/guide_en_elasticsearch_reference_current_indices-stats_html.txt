								Indices level stats provide statistics on different operations happening on an index. The API provides statistics on the index level scope (though most stats can also be retrieved using node level scope).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The following returns high level aggregation and index level stats for all indices:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET /_stats
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Specific index stats can be retrieved using:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET /index1,index2/_stats
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								By default, all stats are returned, returning only specific stats can be specified as well in the URI. Those stats can be any of:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:table
							Element:colgroup
							Element:col
							Element:col
							Element:tbody
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								docs
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The number of docs / deleted docs (docs not yet merged out). Note, affected by refreshing the index.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								store
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The size of the index.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								indexing
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Indexing statistics, can be combined with a comma separated list of
							Element:code
								types
								to provide document type level stats.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								get
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Get statistics, including missing stats.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								search
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Search statistics including suggest statistics. You can include statistics for custom groups by adding an extra
							Element:code
								groups
								parameter (search operations can be associated with one or more groups). The
							Element:code
								groups
								parameter accepts a comma separated list of group names. Use
							Element:code
								_all
								to return statistics for all groups.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								segments
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Retrieve the memory use of the open segments. Optionally, setting the
							Element:code
								include_segment_file_sizes
								flag, report the aggregated disk usage of each one of the Lucene index files.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code

								Completion suggest statistics.
							Element:tr

								Some statistics allow per field granularity which accepts a list comma-separated list of included fields. By default all fields are included:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:table
							Element:colgroup
							Element:col
							Element:col
							Element:tbody
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								fields
							Element:td
							Element:p
								List of fields to be included in the statistics. This is used as the default list unless a more specific field list is provided (see below).
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								completion_fields
							Element:td
							Element:p
								List of fields to be included in the Completion Suggest statistics.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								fielddata_fields
							Element:td
							Element:p
								List of fields to be included in the Fielddata statistics.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Here are some samples:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								# Get back stats for merge and refresh only for all indices GET /_stats/merge,refresh # Get back stats for type1 and type2 documents for the my_index index GET /my_index/_stats/indexing?types=type1,type2 # Get back just search stats for group1 and group2 GET /_stats/search?groups=group1,group2
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The stats returned are aggregated on the index level, with
							Element:code
								primaries
								and
							Element:code
								total
								aggregations, where
							Element:code
								primaries
								are the values for only the primary shards, and
							Element:code
								total
								are the cumulated values for both primary and replica shards.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In order to get back shard level stats, set the
							Element:code
								level
								parameter to
							Element:code
								shards
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Note, as shards move around the cluster, their stats will be cleared as they are created on other nodes. On the other hand, even though a shard "left" a node, that node will still retain the stats that shard contributed to.
