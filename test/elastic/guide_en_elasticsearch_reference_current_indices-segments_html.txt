								Provide low level segments information that a Lucene index (shard level) is built with. Allows to be used to provide more information on the state of a shard and an index, possibly optimization information, data "wasted" on deletes, and so on.
						Node:

								Endpoints include segments for a specific index, several indices, or all:

							Element:dl

								_0
							Element:dd
								The key of the JSON document is the name of the segment. This name is used to generate file names: all files starting with this segment name in the directory of the shard belong to this segment.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								generation
							Element:dd
								A generation number that is basically incremented when needing to write a new segment. The segment name is derived from this generation number.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								num_docs
							Element:dd
								The number of non-deleted documents that are stored in this segment.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								deleted_docs
							Element:dd
								The number of deleted documents that are stored in this segment. It is perfectly fine if this number is greater than 0, space is going to be reclaimed when this segment gets merged.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								size_in_bytes
							Element:dd
								The amount of disk space that this segment uses, in bytes.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								memory_in_bytes
							Element:dd
								Segments need to store some data into memory in order to be searchable efficiently. This number returns the number of bytes that are used for that purpose. A value of -1 indicates that Elasticsearch was not able to compute this number.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								committed
							Element:dd
								Whether the segment has been sync’ed on disk. Segments that are committed would survive a hard reboot. No need to worry in case of false, the data from uncommitted segments is also stored in the transaction log so that Elasticsearch is able to replay changes on the next start.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								search
							Element:dd
								Whether the segment is searchable. A value of false would most likely mean that the segment has been written to disk but no refresh occurred since then to make it searchable.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								version
							Element:dd
								The version of Lucene that has been used to write this segment.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								compound
							Element:dd
								Whether the segment is stored in a compound file. When true, this means that Lucene merged all files from the segment in a single one in order to save file descriptors.
