								Span Not Query
							Element:a

						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Removes matches which overlap with another span query. The span not query maps to Lucene
							Element:code
								SpanNotQuery
								. Here is an example:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET /_search { "query": { "span_not" : { "include" : { "span_term" : { "field1" : "hoya" } }, "exclude" : { "span_near" : { "clauses" : [ { "span_term" : { "field1" : "la" } }, { "span_term" : { "field1" : "hoya" } } ], "slop" : 0, "in_order" : true } } } } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								include
								and
							Element:code
								exclude
								clauses can be any span type query. The
							Element:code
								include
								clause is the span query whose matches are filtered, and the
							Element:code
								exclude
								clause is the span query whose matches must not overlap those returned.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In the above example all documents with the term hoya are filtered except the ones that have
							Element:span
								preceding them.
							Element:em

							Element:col
							Element:tbody
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								pre
							Element:td
							Element:p
								If set the amount of tokens before the include span can’t have overlap with the exclude span.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								post
							Element:td
							Element:p
								If set the amount of tokens after the include span can’t have overlap with the exclude span.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:code
								dist
							Element:td
							Element:p
								If set the amount of tokens from within the include span can’t have overlap with the exclude span. Equivalent of setting both
							Element:code
								pre
								and
							Element:code
								post
								.
