										Element:p
											Previous versions of Elasticsearch accepted the Content-type header field for controlling the media type of the response in the cat API. This is in opposition to the HTTP spec which specifies the Accept header field for this purpose. Elasticsearch now uses the Accept header field and support for using the Content-Type header field for this purpose has been removed.

											Host field removed from the cat nodes API
										Element:a

									Node:

										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											host
											field has been removed from the cat nodes API as its value is always equal to the
										Element:code
											ip
											field. The
										Element:code
											name
											field is available in the cat nodes API and should be used instead of the
										Element:code
											host
											field.

											The fields
										Element:code
											bytes_recovered
											and
										Element:code
											files_recovered
											have been added to the cat recovery API. These fields, respectively, indicate the total number of bytes and files that have been recovered.
									Node:

										Element:p
											The fields
										Element:code
											total_files
											and
										Element:code
											total_bytes
											have been renamed to
										Element:code
											files_total
											and
										Element:code
											bytes_total
											, respectively.

											has been renamed to
										Element:code
											translog_ops_recovered
											, the field
										Element:code
											translog_total
											to
										Element:code
											translog_ops
											and the field
										Element:code
											translog_percent
											to
										Element:code
											translog_ops_percent
											. The short aliases for these fields are
										Element:code
											tor
											,
										Element:code

										Element:p
											The cat nodes endpoint returns
										Element:code
											m
											for master eligible,
										Element:code
											d
											for data, and
										Element:code
											i
											for ingest. A node with no explicit roles will be a coordinating only node and marked with
										Element:code
											-
											. A node can have multiple roles. The master column has been adapted to return only whether a node is the current master (
										Element:code
											*
											) or not (
										Element:code
											-
											).
