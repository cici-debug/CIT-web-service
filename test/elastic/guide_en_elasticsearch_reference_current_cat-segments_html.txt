								The
							Element:code
								segments
								command provides low level information about the segments in the shards of an index. It provides information similar to the
							Element:a
								_segments
								endpoint. For example:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								GET /_cat/segments?v
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								might look like:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								index shard prirep ip segment generation docs.count docs.deleted size size.memory committed searchable version compound test 3 p 127.0.0.1 _0 0 1 0 3kb 2042 false true 6.4.1 true test1 3 p 127.0.0.1 _0 0 1 0 3kb 2042 false true 6.4.1 true
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The output shows information about index names and shard numbers in the first two columns.

								If you only want to get information about segments in one particular index, you can add the index name in the URL, for example
							Element:code
								/_cat/segments/test
								. Also, several indexes can be queried like
							Element:code
								/_cat/segments/test,test1
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								The following columns provide additional monitoring information:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:dl
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								prirep
							Element:dd
								Whether this segment belongs to a primary or replica shard.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								ip
							Element:dd
								The ip address of the segment’s shard.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								segment
							Element:dd
								A segment name, derived from the segment generation. The name is internally used to generate the file names in the directory of the shard this segment belongs to.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								generation
							Element:dd
								The generation number is incremented with each segment that is written. The name of the segment is derived from this generation number.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								docs.count
							Element:dd
								The number of non-deleted documents that are stored in this segment. Note that these are Lucene documents, so the count will include hidden documents (e.g. from nested types).
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								docs.deleted
							Element:dd
								The number of deleted documents that are stored in this segment. It is perfectly fine if this number is greater than 0, space is going to be reclaimed when this segment gets merged.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								size
							Element:dd
								The amount of disk space that this segment uses.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								size.memory
							Element:dd
								Segments store some data into memory in order to be searchable efficiently. This column shows the number of bytes in memory that are used.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								committed
							Element:dd
								Whether the segment has been sync’ed on disk. Segments that are committed would survive a hard reboot. No need to worry in case of false, the data from uncommitted segments is also stored in the transaction log so that Elasticsearch is able to replay changes on the next start.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								searchable
							Element:dd
								True if the segment is searchable. A value of false would most likely mean that the segment has been written to disk but no refresh occurred since then to make it searchable.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								version
							Element:dd
								The version of Lucene that has been used to write this segment.
							Element:dt
							Element:span
								compound
							Element:dd
								Whether the segment is stored in a compound file. When true, this means that Lucene merged all files from the segment in a single one in order to save file descriptors.
