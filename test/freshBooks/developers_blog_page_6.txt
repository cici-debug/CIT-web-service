											Tagify.US won both the FreshBooks First Dollar Earned Award and overall first place at the event. Tagify Us makes it easy to categorize and connect people in your social graph. Here’s what they do, in their own words:

											We have more contacts than we can keep track of. The most successful networkers spend hours a week managing their contacts with tags, groups and notes but this is time consuming it’s near impossible to predict all the different ways you might want to search for someone in the future.
									Node:

										Element:p
											Our solutions is crowd sourcing your contact management with Tagify.us. Each of your contacts has a searchable tag cloud curated by all the people that know them best. You can create public tags that contribute to this cloud or private tags that are just for you. You can manage you personal tag cloud by tagging yourself or adding particular tags to a block list. All of this on the networks you already use such as Facebook, Linkedin and Twitter.

											For part 3 we’ll look at something completely different. Mixins are a way of using multiple inheritance (yes, Python has it!). Most commonly, they’re used to add a set of common helper functions to a class, such as a test class. Consider a test class that inherits from MyFooTestBase for most of its
										Element:code
											setUp()
											, but also needs the commonly-used
										Element:code
											assert_bunnies()
											assertion:
									Node:
									(type) c

											class TestHelper(object): def assert_bunnies(self, a_string): assert a_string == "bunnies", "Failed to find bunnies" class TestMyClass(MyFooTestBase, TestHelper): def test_foo(self): value = self.foo() self.assert_bunnies(value)

											When your method names are distinct, you can mix and match as much as you like, but be careful with your
										Element:code
											__init__()
											method if you’re using Python’s built-in
										Element:code
											unittest
											module; it wants a specific function signature that you probably don’t want to deal with (see below for dealing with multiple inheritance and
										Element:code
											__init__()
											). I’d recommend just using
										Element:a
											nosetests
											as your test collector to avoid having to subclass
										Element:code
											unittest.TestCase

											FreshBooks loves entrepreneurs and an awesome place to find aspiring entrepreneurs is StartupWeekend. Every weekend, somewhere in North America a hundred or two hundred entrepreneurial spirits gather together with the same goal: start a company in 54 hours. From Friday to Sunday, you have to come up with an idea, create a team, prove the idea works, build a prototype, and pitch it to a panel of judges and investors.

											At the recent StartupWeekends Bay Area and Toronto, FreshBooks has been doing something new. We hold the nearly heretical belief that businesses should charge customers money. I know in the “new economy” that is a strange idea, but we believe it works.

											At FreshBooks, we do releases every other week. In the time between, we sometimes need to push small hotfixes out. We use jabber to communicate changes between our operations team and the developers. Tickets or issues that need to be deployed go into a “Hotfix Queue”. In the past we’ve manually managed that queue both in our heads and as the topic of the group chat. As we’ve grown managing this queue mentally and manually in the groupchat title has become a bit tedious. This seemed like a perfect place to implement some better tooling.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											I figured it would be pretty simple to whip up a chat bot in Node.js using
										Element:a
											node-xmpp
											Within an afternoon, I was able to crank out a passable prototype that assisted in managing the outgoing issue queue. Since then, the bot has been enhanced and improved to the point of being a useful, easy to extend, entertaining utility. Its current feature set includes getting weather information, managing our release issue queue, and I’m planning on adding when the next bus will arrive at the office, as soon as the TTC opens that data set up.
