					Receipts should always be linked with one expense, therefore the element is a required element on all receipt calls. Whenever sending an image with the xml request (‘create’ and ‘update’ methods) the request must be implemented as a
				Element:a
					multipart/related
					request where the file will be related with the XML based on its Content-ID (cid).
