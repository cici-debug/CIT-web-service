					Helper Libraries

					The helper libraries provide a set of helper functions in a variety of languages that simplify the process of connecting your application with FreshBooks. These libraries are not required to use the FreshBooks API, but can save time in implementing the FreshBooks API. Please note, these libraries are developed by third parties and are not officially supported by FreshBooks.

					If you’ve released an open source project built on the FreshBooks API and would like to list it here, please
