					If you’re developing a Time Tracking application you’ll be happy to hear that the
				Element:a

					and
				Element:a
					time_entry.get
					now return a read-only ‘billed’ status field in their responses. Additionally, the time_entry API now respects the page and per_page parameters.

					estimate.create
					and
				Element:a
					estimate.update
					methods.
