					A number of great companies have lined up to provide their APIs for you to use, like
				Element:a
					TinEye
					,
				Element:a
					FreshBooks
					(of course),
				Element:a
					Yellow Pages
					, ,
				Element:a
					ContextIO
					,
				Element:a
					Shopify
					and
				Element:a
					Twilio
					. Your mission is to build an all-new application using one or more of those APIs. You’ll have from 9:30 am to 4:30 pm to build your application — and if you’re looking for collaborators you might very well find some on the day. Folks come from all over to join these HackDays events, so you’ll get to meet like-minded hackers and even try working together.
