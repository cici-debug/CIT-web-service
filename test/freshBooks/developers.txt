											The FreshBooks API has a single point of entry, derived from your account URL:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											https://sample.freshbooks.com/api/2.1/xml-in
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Please note the use of https:// in the URL above.
										Element:em
											All FreshBooks API communication is encrypted over HTTPS.
											Any non-secure requests are automatically rejected, so we recommend establishing a test connection with the secure API entry point before sending sensitive data.
