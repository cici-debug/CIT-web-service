					Following the days of calculations that went into my taxes for last year, I decided to try automating as much of my financial forecasting and calculating as possible for the future. Deducting business expenses was a particularly time-consuming task, with different categories of expenses being deducted at different percentages. So I thought, why not mashup the expenses which I already record and categorize in FreshBooks, with spreadsheets in
				Element:a
					Google Docs
					that do the rest of the math.

				Element:p
					In a nutshell, the solution I came up with uses a PHP script to pull expenses from the Freshbooks API into XML, then GDocs reads the XML into a spreadsheet, and calculates deductions based on expense categories, aggregated for each quarter’s estimated taxes. Here’s the process:

											1. FreshBooks Expenses to XML
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Building on an existing
										Element:a
											freshbooks-php library
											, I wrote a PHP script called
										Element:a
											freshbooks_expenses_xml
											. (Link goes to GitHub.)
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To set it up, create a keys.php file, and put the whole package on your server somewhere. Play with the parameters described in the README to get different XML output.

											2. XML to Google Docs
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In cell A1 of a clean spreadsheet, enter this function:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											=importXML(“
										Element:a
											http://your-site.com/freshbooks-expenses/expenses.php?date_from=2011-01-01&amp;date_to=2011-12-31&amp;headers=1&amp;&#x201D
											;, “//expenses/*”).
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											GDocs will fetch the data and populate the spreadsheet. (Note: I had some trouble making the headers consistent with the columns, and worked around it; you might want to do the same by omitting headers=1 in the function and putting in your own headers.)

											3. Making useful tax calculations with the data
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Different expense categories are deducted at different rates, for example, “Meals and Entertainment” is generally deducted at 50%, but hosting services are 100% deductible. (Disclaimer: Do not take this as tax advice! Do your own research on the percentages.) This kind of calculation is easy to do with
										Element:a
											custom GDocs functions
											. (To write a custom function, go to Tools > Scripts > Script Editor.) For example:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											function taxDeductionByCategory(category, amount) { switch(category) { case 'Meals & Entertainment': return amount / 2; default: return amount; } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											I run this function in a Deduction column alongside each expense record.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Next to deductions. I have a column for each Tax Quarter that’s pulled into a separate Income sheet. I use sumif() on the range in the expenses sheet containing the calculated deductions for that quarter, times my expected tax rate, and I know how much tax to pay each quarter.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The next step would be to pull in revenue from Freshbooks as well. Anyone is welcome to add to the project in Github!
