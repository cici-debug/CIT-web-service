										Element:p
											I’ve talked to a couple of people who have said that these events sound interesting, but they don’t have any ideas for stuff that they could build in a day. I always tell them to show up anyway because there are plenty of people who do have ideas but are flying solo and would be eager to take on another team member for the day to help them make sure their idea makes it across the finish line. There’s always a whiteboard or other prominently placed fixture with “Want Help” and “Want TO Help” lists to serve as matchmaker for people who looking to collaborate, so finding a team won’t be a problem. Just bring your computer and your mad skills.

											Our development team has been growing rapidly, and we’re not finished growing yet. As a result, we often have several projects and features in development at one time. For maximum flexibility, we’d ideally manage those small projects by developing them on feature branches then merge them into the mainline trunk when they’re ready. That way, any kind of delay in one feature won’t affect any other projects that we have on the go.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											We’re also flexible about letting people work from home some of the time, and using a centralized repository like SVN limits developers to working connected when they want to commit code. SVN can also be slow and unreliable over our sometimes crowded office upstream connection. All-in-all, Git is a much faster version control system.

											Track Freshbooks Expenses in Google Docs with PHP and XML

											Following the days of calculations that went into my taxes for last year, I decided to try automating as much of my financial forecasting and calculating as possible for the future. Deducting business expenses was a particularly time-consuming task, with different categories of expenses being deducted at different percentages. So I thought, why not mashup the expenses which I already record and categorize in FreshBooks, with spreadsheets in
										Element:a
											Google Docs
											that do the rest of the math.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In a nutshell, the solution I came up with uses a PHP script to pull expenses from the Freshbooks API into XML, then GDocs reads the XML into a spreadsheet, and calculates deductions based on expense categories, aggregated for each quarter’s estimated taxes. Here’s the process:

											Building on an existing

											To set it up, create a keys.php file, and put the whole package on your server somewhere. Play with the parameters described in the README to get different XML output.
