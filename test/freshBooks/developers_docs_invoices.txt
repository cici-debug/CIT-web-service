														In most cases, the returned line_ids will correspond to the new lines in the order that they were sent, however, this behavior is not guaranteed and should not be relied on. If you absolutely require the ability to match the created line_ids with the data you sent, you should create each line in its own request, or use some unique value for each line to eliminate any ambiguity.
