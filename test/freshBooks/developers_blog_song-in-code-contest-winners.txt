											The way Hong codified these lyrics was simple and clever. There's the initialization of the world, then looping of all hundred thousand things to see, and finishes it off on a nice touch with excellent memory management!

											With his code, all the blame is removed and only "Boogie" is added back. What really won us over, is how at the end, feet control gets set to null.
