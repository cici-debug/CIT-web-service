								‘Draft’ status invoices should not be counted as actual invoices.
							Element:li
								‘Partial’ status invoices are marked as ‘Draft’ in the api and should be checked for. These invoices will have a non-zero ‘amount_outstanding’ value.
							Element:li
								FreshBooks supports multiple currencies, so invoices may be in different currencies within a single account.
							Element:li
								There are two types of users in FreshBooks, admin and staff. Be sure to verify that the add-on functions for both admin and staff tokens.
							Element:li
								Customers may have multiple FreshBooks accounts.
							Element:li
								Results from ‘.list’ calls are paginated to 100 results at a time. You will need to page through the results if there are more than 100 items.
							Element:li
								Deleted items are not available through the api.
							Element:li
								FreshBooks offers two methods of authenticating with the API; OAuth and token authentication. All new add-ons to the FreshBooks directory require OAuth authentication through the api. The token method will be reserved strictly for personal api development.
							Element:li
								Clients may have the same email addresses.
							Element:li
								There are two second level domains (xxxx.freshbooks.com, xxxx.billingarm.com) It’s wise to accept subdomains with this regexp:
							Element:em
								subdomain = /(?:https?://)?([^.]+?)(?:[.](?:freshbooks|billingarm)[.]com)?/i
