											When working, the person we’re in contact with at the client, is not always the person who pays your invoices. In the FreshBooks App, you can record numerous contacts per client.

											We’ve added contacts to the client calls in the API.

											Now when you do big-time work for big-time business and use the API to create a client it’s possible to record multiple contacts.

											I love what I do – working on improving the FreshBooks API and providing the tools for our 3rd party developers to build great integrations with our platform. One of the coolest things we do at FreshBooks are our
										Element:a
											HackOffs
											. Its a concept similar to Google’s legendary “20 percent time”. About once a month, we developers stop whatever we’re doing and get to build whatever we want.

											As one of FreshBooks’ newest developers, I had just finished my

											one month of support
											, where every day, I would spend hours listening to customer’s problems, the features they liked and the features they wished existed.The experience inspired me to build something for our customers that they would love. With my first HackOff coming up, it would be the perfect opportunity. I spent weeks wondering what would be most useful to our customers. More gateways? More graphs? More cornified pages? My ideas were ambitious, but an annoying problem kept popping up; as a new developer, I had too little experience with the app’s code.

											Twilio and FreshBooks recently held a
										Element:a
											contest
											. The purpose of the contest was to see what the developer community could build with the
										Element:a
											Twilio API
											and
										Element:a
											FreshBooks API
											. There were a total of 13 entries with some impressive creations all competing for an iPad 2, $100 in FreshBooks and Twilio credit alongside some sweet swag.
									Node:

										Element:p
											There were some awesome entries including an application that automatically calls your FreshBooks clients with overdue invoices, reminding them to pay. Another entrant created a live translation tool using
										Element:a
											Google Translate
											!
									Node:

											The winning contest entry is from
										Element:a
											Brian Shaffer
											. His tool makes it easy for remote workers to log their hours in their FreshBooks account.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Brian built his application using PHP, MySQL, the FreshBooks API and Twilio Voice API. Althought most of his work is done at a computer, it isn’t the norm for everyone – so, he build this tool.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To use Brian’s application, you simply call it when you’d like to start timing your work and call it again when you’re done. Brian’s app takes care of logging the work in your FreshBooks account and records notes about the job.

											Ninja Standups!

											We’ve had to change our standup practice at FreshBooks. The
										Element:img
										Element:strong
											daily standup
											has been a part of FreshBooks developer life for years now. A quick standup is a great way for the members of a team to stay up-to-date on what their colleagues are up to, for folks who need help to get it right away, and for warning those who are unknowingly about to step on thin, suspended-above-razor-blades-and-lava, ice.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											But as a team grows, it gets harder and harder to include everyone in a standup. It starts to take too long — a meeting that ought to be no more than a few minutes consumes a quarter of an hour, and with so many reports coming in, it’s difficult to keep what everyone’s doing in your head. No matter how disciplined your standup practice may be, it will only scale so far. We reached this point recently at FreshBooks, and we’ve struggled to find the right solution.

											One possibility was to carry on as we were, and just take more time on the standup. We decided not to go with this, although it’s arguable that we waited too long. Our standup is approaching twenty people now,…
