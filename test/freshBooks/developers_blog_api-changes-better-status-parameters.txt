					API Changes: Better Status Parameters
					by Jamaal Montasser on April 20/2011

					This morning we added some rules to invoice statuses. Until now it was possible to have some messy invoice statuses – like setting an paid invoice’s status to draft.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Now when creating an invoice, it’s only possible to set the invoice status as:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
				Element:p
					disputed
				Element:li
				Element:p
					draft
				Element:li
				Element:p
					sent
				Element:li
					viewed
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Additionally, you are not able to set an invoice to draft if the current invoice status is:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
				Element:p
					paid
				Element:li
				Element:p
					auto-paid
				Element:li
				Element:p
					retry
				Element:li
				Element:p
					failed
				Element:li
					or partial
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					These better status rules prevent you from getting into a hairy situation like having a “paid” invoice status without actually having a payment on record.

					email us, we always happy to hear from you!
