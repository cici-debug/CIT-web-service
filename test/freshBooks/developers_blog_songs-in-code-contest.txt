					Songs In Code Contest
					by Anton Nguyen on August 18/2011

				Element:p
					A Michael Jackson song came up on my iPod one day while I was writing unit tests. As I listened to him croning on and on about how “Billie Jean” was not his lover, I thought to myself, “why doesn’t he just write a unit test and assert this fact once and for all?”

					This idea reminded me of a twitter meme a few years back (
				Element:a
					#songsincode
					), that was very entertaining. I wanted to give it try with other songs, so I gathered my fellow
				Element:a
					brogrammers
					and we started codifying our favourite songs.
