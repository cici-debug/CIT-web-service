					Brian built his application using PHP, MySQL, the FreshBooks API and Twilio Voice API. Althought most of his work is done at a computer, it isn’t the norm for everyone – so, he build this tool.

					To use Brian’s application, you simply call it when you’d like to start timing your work and call it again when you’re done. Brian’s app takes care of logging the work in your FreshBooks account and records notes about the job.
