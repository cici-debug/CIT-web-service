					Expenses
			Node:

					Expenses that are not associated with a client are represented by client_id as 0. Staff have access to the API calls listed below, but they can only access expenses that belong to them or are assigned to clients they are assigned to.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					IMPORTANT: Expense amounts include taxes. If Expense amount = $100 and tax percent = 5%, then tax amount should be $4.76. This is because the before tax amount is $95.24 and the 5% tax is $4.76, which yields a total of $100, the expense amount.
