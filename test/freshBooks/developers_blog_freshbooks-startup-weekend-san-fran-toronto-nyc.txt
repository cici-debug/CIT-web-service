					StartUp weekend is a 54 hour event where developers, marketers and designers form a team to build and launch a company by the end of the weekend. They’re pretty incredible events with a lot of energy and they always yield some very interesting outcomes.

					Since FreshBooks is a billing and invoicing company, it’s fitting that we will be cheering for all teams, but extra-hard for teams that will be charging their users, rather than generating revenue other ways.

					In light of this, we will be giving
				Element:strong
					an award
					at the events in San Fransisco (this weekend, May 6-8), Toronto (June 3-5) and NYC (June 10-12) to the team most likely to succeed in charging it’s users. This award includes a framed certificate (shown above) and 1 years use of FreshBooks since it’ll come in handy if you’re billing your customers!
