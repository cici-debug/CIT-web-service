					New API Features debuting September 21

					Hi there FreshBooks integrators and other generally interested parties!
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					As of today, we have some new API features to announce. The keen-eyed among you may have already noticed
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					some new elements in the xml we send in response to various API calls. If you didn’t, don’t sweat it, I’ll tell you
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					about them now:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:h3
											Folders
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Within the FreshBooks web UI, many items can have a visibility status of Active, Archived, or Deleted. For the purposes of
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											the API, we decided to call those three states “folders” and we now provide a <folder> element to indicate which
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											of the three states the object is in. Yes, that’s right. You can now list
										Element:strong
											deleted
											items through the API.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											That’s not really the cool part though. You can also now filter on the folder when you make a request to any of the *.list
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											methods, and specify which folder you’d want to get objects from:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											&lt!--List only active invoices--> <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"> <request method="invoice.list"> <folder>active</folder> </request>
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Note that this means that by specifying <folder>deleted</folder>, you can now access deleted items via the API (yay!),
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											something that wasn’t possible before. Also note that only the .list methods have changed.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you request a deleted object with one of the .get methods, you will still get nada, nor will
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											you be able to update deleted items via the API.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The affected methods:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											invoice.list
										Element:li
											estimate.list
										Element:li
											item.list
										Element:li
											recurring.list
										Element:li
											client.list
										Element:li
											expense.list
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Lastly, the default behavior hasn’t changed. If you omit the <folder> element from your .list
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											requests, the API will return both Active and Archived items, as it always has.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:h3
											Client Statment links
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											We now include direct links the clients’ statements in the <links>
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											section of the <client> output from both client.list and client.get.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											And there was much rejoicing.
