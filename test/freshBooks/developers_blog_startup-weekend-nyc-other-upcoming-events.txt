					We have more contacts than we can keep track of. The most successful networkers spend hours a week managing their contacts with tags, groups and notes but this is time consuming it’s near impossible to predict all the different ways you might want to search for someone in the future.

					Our solutions is crowd sourcing your contact management with Tagify.us. Each of your contacts has a searchable tag cloud curated by all the people that know them best. You can create public tags that contribute to this cloud or private tags that are just for you. You can manage you personal tag cloud by tagging yourself or adding particular tags to a block list. All of this on the networks you already use such as Facebook, Linkedin and Twitter.
