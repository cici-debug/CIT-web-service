					UTF-8 is here!

					Today I’m happy to announce that FreshBooks is fully UTF-8!
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					What this means for you: You can use unicode snowman and all the other characters in the
				Element:a
					Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane
					to your heart’s content, knowing that each symbol takes the space of only one code point (essentially a “letter”), for example being able to fit a full 50 non-Latin characters into an invoice item name. It also means that you’ll be able to use
				Element:a
					snowmen
					and other extended characters in the time tracking section of FreshBooks!
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					What this means for you as an API consumer: You can now send FreshBooks the full gamut of BMP characters directly as UTF-8 with no encoding shenanigans! Previously anything not in the
				Element:a
					ISO-8859-1
					character set would be smashed into a question mark, including XML entities representing those extended charaters. As a workaround, one could “double-encode” entities, e.g. your XML would contain the ASCII string
				Element:span
					&amp;#9731;
					to get a snowman. This is no longer required!

					Here’s how things work, starting today:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:table
				Element:thead
				Element:tr
				Element:th
					If you submit this via your browser
				Element:th
					It looks like this in the browser
				Element:th
					And like this in an API response
				Element:tbody
				Element:tr
				Element:td
					&amp;
				Element:td
					&
				Element:td
					&amp;
				Element:tr
				Element:td
					&#9731;
				Element:td
					☃
				Element:td

				Element:tr
				Element:td

				Element:tr
				Element:th
					If you submit this via the API
				Element:th
					It looks like this in the browser
				Element:th

				Element:tbody

			Node:

				Element:p
					For the next month or so we’ll continue to accept HTML entities through the web application (and double-encoded entities through the API), and display them just like we have for years. But after that, we’ll migrate all the exiting entity-based characters into real UTF-8 codepoints, and flip the switch such that plain text is
				Element:em
					plain
					text.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					When that happens, the behaviour will change like this:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:table
				Element:thead
				Element:tr
				Element:th
					If you submit this via your browser
				Element:th
					It looks like this in the browser

					And like this in an API response
				Element:tbody
				Element:tr

				Element:tr

				Element:tr
				Element:td
					&amp;#9731;
				Element:td
					&amp;#9731;
				Element:td
					&amp;amp;#9731;
			Node:
