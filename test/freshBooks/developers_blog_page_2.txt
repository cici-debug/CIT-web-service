											In January 2010 we were pleased to announce the ability to
										Element:a
											bill in multiple currencies from FreshBooks
											. In 2012 we announced
										Element:a

											If you’ve ever had to work with more than one currency in an application, you know how painful and annoying it can be. Providing reasonable rates of exchange, keeping track of payments in one currency against expenses in another — it’s ugly. It’s not even worth it. So, we’re throwing it out.

											Until now. We can tell you exactly what your FreshBuck is worth: six seconds of free FreshBooks time. That’s right — for only ƒ10 you get a whole minute of FreshBooks. ƒ144,400 equals a whole DAY of FreshBooks in your pocket.

											We recently released a totally re-designed and re-engineered account overview. It replaces one of the slowest pages in FreshBooks with a faster, richer and more interactive client side application. It was built by a team of 4 over the course of a few weeks, and I’d like to share how we built it and some of the lessons we learned along the way.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When reviewing just how much data we had planned to pack on each page it became very apparent that generating a huge HTML page wasn’t going to provide the experience we wanted. The existing homepage is consistently one of the slowest pages in our application. Basically doubling the amount of data displayed on the existing page was not going to be performant. We quickly decided that building the overview as a mini client-side application was going to provide the most performant end result.

											The server-side architecture is organized around the concept of discrete panels with a single responsibility/function. Visually and structurally the overview is divided into a number of independent panels. Each panel is self-contained and provides information on a different aspect or dimension of your business. Not every FreshBooks account uses every feature, so…

											Git: Not Just Source Control

											At FreshBooks, we
										Element:a
											really like git
											for our source control. Git provides us with easy branch management, reliable source control, and the commands are intuitive. But git’s usefulness isn’t limited to source control. We’ve discovered that git’s elegant interface and potent functionality make it useful for all sorts of applications.

											For example, a couple of months ago our internal Jabber server was down for maintenance and the maintenance window lasted a bit longer than expected (something about Erlang packages and CentOS, I think). I was working on a project with some other developers located dozens of feet apart and we had been collaborating with each other using Jabber to save the walk to each other’s desks. With the Jabber server down, and facing the productivity hit of having to walk across the office, we did what any developer would do and worked around the problem.
