								Response
						Node:

								The response contains a list of items with reactions followed by pagination information.
						Node:

							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "ok": true, "items": [ { "type": "message", "channel": "C2147483705", "message": { ...

						Node:

							Element:p
								Different item types can be reacted to. Every item in the list has a
							Element:code
								type
								property, the other properties depend on the type of item. The possible types are:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								: the item will have a
							Element:code
								message
							Element:code
								message
								property containing a
							Element:a
								message object
								and a
							Element:code
								channel
								property containing the channel ID for the message.
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								: this item will have a
							Element:code
								file
							Element:code
								file
								property containing a
							Element:a
								file object
								.
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								: the item will have a
							Element:code
								file_comment
							Element:code
								file
								property containing the
							Element:a
								file object
								and a
							Element:code
								comment
								property containing the file comment.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The users array in the
							Element:code
								reactions
								property might not always contain all users that have reacted (we limit it to X users, and X might change), however
							Element:code
								count
								will always represent the count of all users who made that reaction (i.e. it may be greater than
							Element:code
								users.length
								). If the authenticated user has a given reaction then they are guaranteed to appear in the
							Element:code
								users
								array, regardless of whether
							Element:code
								count
								is greater than
							Element:code
								users.length
								or not. If the complete list of users is required they can still be obtained by specifying the
							Element:code
								full
								argument.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The paging information contains the
							Element:code
								count
								of items returned, the
							Element:code
								total
								number of items reacted to, the
							Element:code
								page
								of results returned in this response and the total number of
							Element:code
								pages
								available. Please note that the max
							Element:code
								count
								value is
							Element:code
								1000
								and the max
							Element:code
								page
								value is
							Element:code
								100
								.

								Authentication token is for a deleted user or team.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								invalid_arg_name
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was passed an argument whose name falls outside the bounds of common decency. This includes very long names and names with non-alphanumeric characters other than
							Element:code
								_
								. If you get this error, it is typically an indication that you have made a
							Element:em
								very
								malformed API call.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								invalid_array_arg
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was passed a PHP-style array argument (e.g. with a name like
							Element:code
								foo[7]
								). These are never valid with the Slack API.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								invalid_charset
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was called via a
							Element:code
								POST
								request, but the

								specified in the

								Content-Type
								header was invalid. Valid charset names are:

							Element:code
								iso-8859-1

							Element:tr
							Element:td

								request with

								Content-Type
							Element:code

								or
							Element:code
								multipart/form-data

							Element:tr

								invalid_post_type
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was called via a

							Element:code
								text/plain
								.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code

								The method was called via a

								Content-Type
								header.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code

								The method was called via a

								Description
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								missing_charset
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was called via a
							Element:code
								POST
								request, and recommended practice for the specified
							Element:code
								Content-Type
								is to include a
							Element:code
								charset
								parameter. However, no
							Element:code
								charset
								was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g.
							Element:code
								text/plain
								) are the ones for which
							Element:code
								charset
								is recommended.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								superfluous_charset
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was called via a
							Element:code
								POST
								request, and the specified
							Element:code
								Content-Type
								is not defined to understand the
							Element:code
								charset
								parameter. However,
							Element:code
								charset
								was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g.
							Element:code
								multipart/form-data
								) are the ones for which
							Element:code
								charset
								is superfluous.
