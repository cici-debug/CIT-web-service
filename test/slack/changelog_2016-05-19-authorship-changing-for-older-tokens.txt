					Long ago, before we made generating your own tokens easy, a small number of enterprising users and developers scoured through client-side code to discover embedded user tokens and began posting messages and performing other skunkworks operations with them. We applaud this adventurous spirit!
			Node:

				Element:p
					Today we take the first step in retiring usage of these antiquated tokens, by changing their behavior when used to post messages through
				Element:a
					.
				Element:code
					chat.postMessage

								What's changing:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								These changes effect only outmoded tokens using
							Element:code
								chat.postMessage
								, which can be identified by their leading characters of
							Element:code
								xoxo-
								and
							Element:code
								xoxs-
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Instead of allowing the authoring identity to be altered using the
							Element:code
								username
								,
							Element:code
								icon_url
								, and
							Element:code
								icon_emoji
								parameters, messages posted with these outdated tokens will default to the original user's identity.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								So if
							Element:em
								@jane
								uses these tokens in a script to post as
							Element:em
								@captain_janeway
								, posts will now be attributed to
							Element:em
								@jane
								. The tokens belong to
							Element:em
								@jane
								after all.

								Today
								â€” this change is effective immediately. These tokens are seldom used and the impact on teams and workflows should be minimal.

								How to adapt:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								We strongly suggest those using these vintage tokens to migrate to
							Element:a
								incoming webhooks
								or use
							Element:a
								scoped OAuth tokens
								to continue posting with
							Element:code
								chat.postMessage
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Another viable, though discouraged option is to use
							Element:a
								test tokens
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								We recommend migrating even if you're fine with this new behavior, as these tokens are not meant to be used for this purpose.
						Node:

							Element:p
								Please review the tokens you're using and adapt your usage as necessary. Have questions? We're happy to help! Feel free to contact us
