					The
				Element:code
					subteam_updated
					event is sent to all connections for a team when an existing User Group is updated. This event is triggered for changes to the User Group information (name, description, or handle) as well as the members of the group. Clients can use this to update their local list of groups and group members. The
				Element:code
					users
					field is truncated at 500, however the
				Element:code
					user_count
					field will still show the actual count.
			Node:

				Element:p
					This
				Element:a
					event type
					may also arise when a subteam has been disabled.
