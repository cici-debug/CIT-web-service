								What are these fields for?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								event_ts
								field differs from the
							Element:code
								ts
								timestamp fields you already receive with most events. The
							Element:code
								ts
								field is associated with the object or transition the event is describing while the
							Element:code
								event_ts
								attribute refers to the streamed event.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								ts
								field is like a date scrawled on a letter contained within an envelope â€” it's part of the message itself.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								event_ts
								is like a postmark stamped on the envelope as part of the postal process, an artifact of the workflow used to deliver the message to the intended recipient.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								As with
							Element:code
								ts
								,
							Element:code
								event_ts
								is expressed in a kind of "
							Element:a
								epoch time
								", contained within a string and including fractions of seconds.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								An example
							Element:code
								event_ts
								timestamp value of
							Element:code
								"1361482916.000004"
								, could be converted to UTC as
							Element:code
								2013-02-21 21:41:56 UTC
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:code
								event_ts
								is especially useful when noting your real time progress through a channel's history.

								What's changing:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								We're adding
							Element:code
								event_ts
								timestamp fields to additional
							Element:a
								RTM API
							Element:a
								events
								, including but certainly not limited to event fan favorites like
							Element:code
								group_archive
								,
							Element:code
								user_change
								, and
							Element:code
								star_added
								.

								How to prepare:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								We don't anticipate developers needing to prepare for this additive API alteration.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Streamed events will simply gain a
							Element:code
								event_ts
								field as part of their JSON structure.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This field is already present on a number of events including
							Element:code
								im_history_changed
								,
							Element:code
								emoji_changed
								and of course, our medium of conversation:
							Element:code
								message
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you can reliably maintain a connection with the RTM API today, it is unlikely you'll encounter any difficulties with this field addition.

								We'll begin adding these fields sometime in mid to late
							Element:strong
								June 2016
								. Let us know about any anticipated issues by contacting us
