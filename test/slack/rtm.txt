					Real Time Messaging API
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The Real Time Messaging API is a WebSocket-based API that allows you to receive
				Element:a
					events
					from Slack in real time and send messages as users. It's sometimes referred to as simply the "RTM API".
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					It is the basis for all Slack clients. It's also commonly used with the
				Element:a
					bot user integration
					to create helper bots for your team.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					If you prefer events to be
				Element:em
					pushed
					to you instead, we recommend using the HTTP-based
				Element:a
					Events API
					instead. Most event types supported by the RTM API are also
				Element:a
					available in the Events API
					.

								Basics
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To begin a RTM session make an
							Element:a
								authenticated
								call to the
							Element:a
								rtm.start API method
								. This provides an initial set of team metadata and a message server WebSocket URL. Once you have connected to the message server it will provide a stream of events, including both messages and updates to the current state of the team. This allows a client to easily maintain a synchronized local copy of all team data and messages.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The Websocket URLs provided by
							Element:code
								rtm.start
								are single-use and are only valid for 30 seconds, so make sure to connect quickly. If you connect successfully the first event received will be a hello:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "type": "hello" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This will be followed by any events that occurred between the call to
							Element:code
								rtm.start
								and the connection to the message server. If you're reconnecting after a network problem this initial set of events may include a response to the last message sent on a previous connection (with a
							Element:code
								reply_to
								) so a client can confirm that message was received.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If there was a problem connecting an error will be returned, including a descriptive error message:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "type": "error", "error": { "code": 1, "msg": "Socket URL has expired" } }

								Events
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Almost everything that happens in Slack will result in an event being sent to all connected clients. The simplest event is a message sent from a user:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "type": "message", "ts": "1358878749.000002", "user": "U023BECGF", "text": "Hello" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Every event has a
							Element:code
								type
								property which describes the type of event. Our servers currently send the following
							Element:a
								event types
								:

											You can send a message to a private group or direct message channel in the same way, but using a Group ID (
										Element:code
											C024BE91L
											) or DM channel ID (
										Element:code
											D024BE91L

									Node:

											To send a message both
										Element:em
											as
											and
										Element:em
											to
											the authenticating user, use the correct direct message channel ID for that user. The IM ID can be found as part of the response to
										Element:a
											, or by consulting
										Element:code
											rtm.start
										Element:a
											.

									Node:

											The RTM API only supports posting simple messages formatted using our
										Element:a
											default message formatting mode
											. It does not support
										Element:a
											attachments
											or other message formatting modes. To post a more complex message as a user clients can call the
										Element:a
											chat.postMessage Web API method
											with
										Element:code
											as_user
											set to true.

											Handling responses
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Once the JSON has been sent to the server visual clients should immediately display the text in the channel, grayed out or otherwise marked to indicate that it is "pending". At some point after that, usually a few milliseconds later, the server will send a confirmation that the message was received:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											{ "ok": true, "reply_to": 1, "ts": "1355517523.000005", "text": "Hello world" }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Replies to messages sent by clients will always contain two properties: a boolean
										Element:code
											ok
											indicating whether they succeeded and an integer
										Element:code
											reply_to
											indicating which message they are in response to.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In the case of a reply to a chat message, if successful, the reply will contain the canonical recorded timestamp of the message. All messages within a single channel are guaranteed to have a unique timestamp which is ASCII sortable. Given the precision of the timestamp, clients should treat these timestamps as strings, not floats/doubles. Once a successful reply has been returned, the message in the chat log should no longer be grayed out - it has now been delivered.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Chat message replies also contain the message text, which may vary from the sent message due to URL detection.

								Typing indicators
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Clients can send a typing indicator to indicate that the user is currently writing a message to send to a channel:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "id": 1, "type": "typing", "channel": "C024BE91L" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This can be sent on every key press in the chat input unless one has been sent in the last three seconds. Unless there is an error the server will not send a reply, but it will send a "user_typing" event to all team members in the channel.

								Ping and Pong
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Clients should try to quickly detect disconnections, even in idle periods, so that users can easily tell the difference between being disconnected and everyone being quiet. Not all web browsers support the WebSocket ping spec, so the RTM protocol also supports ping/pong messages. When there is no other activity clients should send a ping every few seconds. To send a ping, send the following JSON:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "id": 1234, // ID, see "sending messages" above "type": "ping", ... }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can supply any number of extra "flat" arguments (that is: only scalar values, no arrays or objects). These will be included in the pong message that is sent back. For example, a client could include a local timestamp in the ping message so it can calculate round-trip latency:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "id": 1234, "type": "ping", "time": 1403299273342 }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This will be included in the reply from the server:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "reply_to": 1234, "type": "pong", "time": 1403299273342 }

								Limits
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The message server will disconnect any client that sends a message longer than 16 kilobytes. This includes all parts of the message, including JSON syntax, not just the message text. Clients should limit messages sent to channels to 4000 characters, which will always be under 16k bytes even with a message comprised solely of non-BMP Unicode characters at 4 bytes each. If the message is longer a client should prompt to split the message into multiple messages, create a snippet or create a post.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								As with all Slack APIs, the RTM API is subject to
							Element:a
								rate limits
								. Clients should not send more than one message per second sustained. If you do you may receive an error message or be disconnected.

								What's a WebSocket?

							Element:a
								RTM API
								. Many
