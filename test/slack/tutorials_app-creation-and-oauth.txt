					Apps make Slack a more productive and enjoyable place to get work done. Letâ€™s not also forget that super amazing features, like the
				Element:a
					Events API
					and
				Element:a
					message buttons
					, are exclusive to apps. If you want to create an app and install it on your team â€“ but are new to Slackâ€™s OAuth process â€“ this tutorial is for you.
			Node:

				Element:p
					You will have a shiny new app installed on your team upon completing these three steps:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ol
				Element:li
					Create your Slack app
				Element:li
					Setup the OAuth installation flow
				Element:li
					Install the app on your team
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					A
				Element:strong
					Node.js
					app will be used as an example. If you prefer Python, Ruby, or another web-friendly language, you should be able to follow along and translate to your chosen language.

													Element:ul
													Element:li
														Publicly accessible server running
													Element:a
														Node.js
													Element:li
													Element:p
														Following Node.js modules:
													Element:ul
													Element:li
													Element:a
														: popular http framework
													Element:strong
														Express
													Element:li
													Element:a
														: simple http request client
													Element:strong
														Request
													Element:li
													Element:a
														: loads environment variables from a .env file
													Element:strong
														Dotenv
													Element:p
														For example, the beginning of your server file should resemble:
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														require('dotenv').config() var express = require('express') var request = require('request') var app = express()
												Node:
												(type) c

														Our complete
													Element:a
														OAuth documentation
														is a good reference as you go through the tutorial.

														Go to
													Element:a
														https://api.slack.com/apps
														and click the big green
													Element:strong
														Create New App
														button. Enter a name for your app and click the next prominent green button.
													Element:li
													Element:p
														The
													Element:strong
														Basic Information
														link on the left hand side of your appâ€™s settings page contains information youâ€™ll need, such as the
													Element:strong
														Client ID
														and
													Element:strong
														Client Secret
														, to authenticate OAuth requests for your app. Copy these to your
													Element:strong
														.env
														file on your server. See docs
													Element:a
														here
														for variable format if youâ€™re following the Node.js example.
													Element:li
													Element:p
														Itâ€™s time to setup a
													Element:strong
														Redirect URL
														for your app. This is the endpoint for Slack to send a unique temporary code to your server during a userâ€™s installation. Your server will then send back this code, along with your
													Element:strong
														Client ID
														and
													Element:strong
														Client Secret
														, so that we know we can trust you.
													Element:p
														The Redirect URL must be publicly accessible and secure. If you want to run your server locally, e.g. on
													Element:code
														localhost
														,
													Element:strong
														Ngrok
														is a service that will create a tunnel to your local or private endpoint.
													Element:p
														Hereâ€™s a quick
													Element:a
														ngrok tutorial
														to get you up and running. ðŸ’¯
													Element:p
														You can save your
													Element:strong
														Redirect URL
														in the
													Element:strong
														OAuth & Permissions
														section on the left. After you save your changes, you can always come back later and change them.

														Thatâ€™s it for your Slack app settings page. Now let's get your Node.js app configured for OAuth glory!

														Setup OAuth installation flow
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The
													Element:a
														Add to Slack button
														is an easy way to install the app. Navigate
													Element:a
														here
														, select your new app from the
													Element:strong
														Code for app
														dropdown menu and tick your desired scopes from the list of
													Element:code
														incoming-webhook
														,
													Element:code
														commands
														, and
													Element:code
														bot
														. Now copy the HTML for the button to a file on your server. We'll call it
													Element:strong
														add_to_slack.html
														.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Scopes are an integral part of OAuth as they define your appâ€™s permissions to access API methods and bundled features, such as
													Element:a
														webhooks
														and
													Element:a
														slash commands
														. Browse the
													Element:a
														OAuth Scopes page
														to learn more.
												Node:

														Next, add a GET route to your server file for your basic, yet elegant, button:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														app.get('/auth', (req, res) =>{ res.sendFile(__dirname + '/add_to_slack.html') })
			Node:

													Element:h4
														Add Redirect URL route
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														When a user clicks your
													Element:strong
														Add to Slack
														button, a request is sent to Slackâ€™s servers. The
													Element:strong
														Client ID
														sent via the button click is validated and a
													Element:code
														code
														is sent as a
													Element:strong
														GET
														request to your
													Element:strong
														Redirect URL
														. The
													Element:code
														code
														is in a JSON object named
													Element:code
														query
														of the request, i.e.
													Element:code
														req.query.code
														.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														You serverâ€™s task is to receive this
													Element:code
														code
														and send it back along with the
													Element:strong
														Client ID
														and
													Element:strong
														Client Secret
														as parameters to the OAuth Access Token URL:
													Element:a
														https://slack.com/api/oauth.access
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The response body of your request will contain the tokens, webhooks and IDs that your app can use to make its magic happen. Example response body:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														{ "ok":true, "access_token":"xoxp-...", "scope":"YOUR_SCOPES", "user_id":"U...", "team_name":"TEAM_NAME", "team_id":"TEAM_ID", "incoming_webhook": { "channel":"#general", "channel_id":"C...", "configuration_url":"https:\\/\\/my.slack.com\\/services\\/B...", "url":"https:\\/\\/hooks.slack.com\\/services\\/TEAM_ID\\/B...\\/..." } }
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														See the following snippet to accomplish the receipt of the
													Element:code
														code
														to your
													Element:strong
														Redirect URL
														, the GET request back to Slack and the response with your newly installed appâ€™s credentials. Not too hard, hey?
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														app.get('/auth/redirect', (req, res) =>{ var options = { uri: 'https://slack.com/api/oauth.access?code=' +req.query.code+ '&client_id='+process.env.CLIENT_ID+ '&client_secret='+process.env.CLIENT_SECRET+ '&redirect_uri='+process.env.REDIRECT_URI, method: 'GET' } request(options, (error, response, body) => { var JSONresponse = JSON.parse(body) if (!JSONresponse.ok){ console.log(JSONresponse) res.send("Error encountered: \n"+JSON.stringify(JSONresponse)).status(200).end() }else{ console.log(JSONresponse) res.send("Success!") } }) })
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														In the above example,
													Element:code
														console.log()
														is used to view the response body. In your code, youâ€™ll want save the response object immediately in a safe and secure place.
													Element:strong
														You only get one chance to save it!
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Check out the
													Element:a
														Safely Storing Credentials
														page for best practices on how to handle this sensitive data.

													Element:p
														Now open your
													Element:strong
														Add to Slack
														button page in your browser, click on the button and you should be navigated through the installation of your app!
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														If installed successfully, your app will be listed here:
													Element:a
