			Node:

				Element:p
					We've added a new
				Element:a
					OAuth permission scope
					called
				Element:code
					users:read.email
					and it provides a new explicit, additive way to request access to team email addresses. If you don't need email addresses but do need other user info,
				Element:code
					users:read
					is still all you need.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Apps created before
				Element:strong
					January 4th, 2017
					are grandfathered and will continue behaving in a backwards-compatible way. Apps created after that date must request the new
				Element:code
					users:read.email
					scope. Regardless of creation date, we encourage all apps to migrate to this new scope.

								Slack apps created after the cut off date must request the new
							Element:code
								users:read.email
								OAuth scope to access the
							Element:code
								email
								field in
							Element:a
								user objects
								returned by the
							Element:a
								and
							Element:code
								users.list
							Element:a
								web API methods.
							Element:code
								users.info
							Element:code
								users:read
								will no longer be a sufficient scope for this data field.

								We're grandfathering existing Slack apps so these methods will continue including

								email
								when you've only requested or are requesting
							Element:code
								users:read
								.
						Node:

								That said, we encourage you to use the new scopes anyway!
						Node:

								Additionally, the OAuth scope
							Element:code

								can also be used to obtain access to email addresses, as they are considered part of the user's profile obtained via

								.
							Element:code
								users.profile.get
						Node:

								Furthermore,

								continues to operate the same way it does today â€” email address is yielded for the current user signing in to your application via the

								identity.email
								scope.
