								You must provide either a

						Node:

							Element:p
								The content of the file can either be posted using an
							Element:code
								enctype
								of
							Element:code
								multipart/form-data
								(with the file parameter named
							Element:code
								file
								), in the usual way that files are uploaded via the browser, or the content of the file can be sent as a POST var called
							Element:code
								content
								. The latter should be used for creating a "file" from a long message/paste and forces "editable" mode.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In both cases, the type of data in the file will be intuited from the filename and the magic bytes in the file, for supported formats.
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								Sending a valid

							Element:p
								Files uploaded via

						Node:

								The file can also be shared directly into channels on upload, by specifying an optional argument
							Element:code
								channels
								. If there's more than one channel name or ID in the

								string, they should be comma-separated.

								Authentication token is for a deleted user or team.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								invalid_arg_name
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was passed an argument whose name falls outside the bounds of common decency. This includes very long names and names with non-alphanumeric characters other than
							Element:code
								_
								. If you get this error, it is typically an indication that you have made a
							Element:em
								very
								malformed API call.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								invalid_array_arg
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was passed a PHP-style array argument (e.g. with a name like
							Element:code
								foo[7]
								). These are never valid with the Slack API.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								invalid_charset

								The method was called via a

								Description

								missing_charset
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was called via a
							Element:code
								POST
								request, and recommended practice for the specified
							Element:code
								Content-Type
								is to include a
							Element:code
								charset
								parameter. However, no
							Element:code
								charset
								was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g.
							Element:code
								text/plain
								) are the ones for which
							Element:code
								charset
								is recommended.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								superfluous_charset
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was called via a
							Element:code
								POST
								request, and the specified
							Element:code
								Content-Type
								is not defined to understand the
							Element:code
								charset
								parameter. However,
							Element:code
								charset
								was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g.
							Element:code
								multipart/form-data
								) are the ones for which
							Element:code
								charset
								is superfluous.
