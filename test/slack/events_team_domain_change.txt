					The
				Element:code
					team_domain_change
					event is sent to all connections for a team when the team domain changes.
			Node:
			(type) c

				Element:p
					Since the existing domain will continue to work (causing a redirect) until it is claimed by another team, clients don't need to do anything special with this event. It is sent for the benefit of our web client, which needs to reload when the domain changes.
