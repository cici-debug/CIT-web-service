					Outgoing Webhooks
					You're viewing documentation on legacy custom integrations, an older way for teams to build into their Slack team. To securely utilize the newest platform features like message buttons & the Events API, build

					internal
					integrations

								Get data out of Slack in real-time.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Outgoing webhooks will send an HTTP POST request to your specified URL when a message matches one or both of the following conditions:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								The message is in the specified
							Element:strong
								channel
							Element:li
								The message begins with one of the defined
							Element:strong
								trigger word(s)
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This is useful for providing automated responses to messages your team members post. For example, you might have a service that posts the status of a server. This service could receive the HTTP POST from Slack and automatically respond with a status update.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:a
								outgoing webhook integration
								is only available in public channels. If you would like to get data out of private groups and DMs in real-time, try a
							Element:a
								slash command
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Outgoing webhooks are the only kind of custom integration
							Element:em
								not
								supported by
							Element:a
								Slack apps
								. To build similar functionality in a Slack app, use the
							Element:a
								Events API
								.

									Node:

											When a chat message is received that matches the conditions, a POST will be sent to all of the URLs defined like so:
									Node:

										Element:pre
										Element:code
											token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX team_id=T0001 team_domain=example channel_id=C2147483705 channel_name=test timestamp=1355517523.000005 user_id=U2147483697 user_name=Steve text=googlebot: What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow? trigger_word=googlebot:

											Responding
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If the handler wishes to post a response back into the channel, the following JSON should be returned as the body of the response:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											{ "text": "African or European?" }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Empty bodies or bodies with an empty
										Element:code
											text
											property will simply be ignored. Non-200 responses will be retried a reasonable number of times.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Responses will be posted using the bot name and icon configured in the integration. However, if you would like to change the name on a per-response basis, simply include the
										Element:code
											username
											parameter in your response.
