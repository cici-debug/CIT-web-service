					A message was sent to a channel
			Node:

				Element:p
					A
				Element:code
					message
					is delivered from several sources:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
					They are sent via the
				Element:a
					Real Time Messaging API
					when a message is sent to a channel to which you subscribe. This message should immediately be displayed in the client.
				Element:li
					They are returned via calls to
				Element:a
					channels.history
					,
				Element:a
					im.history
					or
				Element:a
					groups.history
				Element:li
					They are returned as
				Element:code
					latest
					property on
				Element:a
					channel
					,
				Element:a
					group
					and
				Element:a
					im
					objects.

					A simple message is self explanatory:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					{ "type": "message", "channel": "C2147483705", "user": "U2147483697", "text": "Hello world", "ts": "1355517523.000005" }
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The
				Element:code
					channel
					property is the ID of the channel, private group or DM channel this message is posted in. The
				Element:code
					user
					property is the ID of the user speaking, the
				Element:code
					text
					property is the text spoken, and
				Element:code
					ts
					is the unique (per-channel) timestamp.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Messages can also include an
				Element:code
					attachments
					property, containing a list of
				Element:a
					attachment objects
					.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					If the message has been edited after posting it will include an
				Element:code
					edited
					property, including the user ID of the editor, and the timestamp the edit happened. The original text of the message is not available. For example:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					{ "type": "message", "channel": "C2147483705", "user": "U2147483697", "text": "Hello, world!", "ts": "1355517523.000005", "edited": { "user": "U2147483697", "ts": "1355517536.000001" } }

								Message subtypes
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Unlike other event types,
							Element:code
								message
								events can have a subtype. For example, this is a channel join message:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "type": "message", "subtype": "channel_join", "text": "<@U023BECGF|bobby> has joined the channel", "ts": "1403051575.000407", "user": "U023BECGF" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								They are structured in this way so that clients can either support them fully by having distinct behavior for each different subtype, or can fallback to a simple mode by just displaying the text of the message.

						(type) c

								Hidden subtypes
						Node:

								Some subtypes have a special hidden property. These indicate messages that are part of the history of a channel but should not be displayed to users. Examples include records of message edits or deletes:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre

						Node:

								Hidden messages are only sent over the Real Time Messaging API. They will not appear as the
							Element:code

								property on
							Element:a
								channel
								,
							Element:a

								or
							Element:a

						Node:

						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "type": "message", "channel": "C2147483705", "user": "U2147483697", "text": "Hello world", "ts": "1355517523.000005", "is_starred": true, "pinned_to": ["C024BE7LT", ...], "reactions": [ { "name": "astonished", "count": 3, "users": [ "U1", "U2", "U3" ] }, { "name": "facepalm", "count": 1034, "users": [ "U1", "U2", "U3", "U4", "U5" ] } ] }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								is_starred
								property is present and true if the calling user has starred the message, else it is omitted.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								pinned_to
								array, if present, contains the IDs of any channels to which the message is currently pinned.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								reactions
								property, if present, contains any reactions that have been added to the message and gives information about the type of reaction, the total number of users who added that reaction and a (possibly incomplete) list of users who have added that reaction to the message. The users array in the
							Element:code
								reactions
								property might not always contain all users that have reacted (we limit it to X users, and X might change), however
							Element:code
								count
								will always represent the count of all users who made that reaction (i.e. it may be greater than
							Element:code
								users.length
								). If the authenticated user has a given reaction then they are guaranteed to appear in the
							Element:code
								users
								array, regardless of whether
							Element:code
								count
								is greater than
							Element:code
								users.length
								or not.
