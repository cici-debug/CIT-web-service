								Attachments can be added to messages in different ways:

							Element:ul

								For

								Incoming Webhooks
								, send a regular payload, but include an

							Element:li
								For
							Element:a
								the Web API
								, include an
							Element:code
								attachments
								property, containing a JSON-encoded array of attachment hashes.

								Attaching link content to messages
						Node:

								Slack automatically scans URLs found in messages and creates message attachments based on the content it finds in those URLs. We call this functionality "unfurling".
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:a
								Slack apps
								can also subscribe to link domains and provide custom unfurl behavior — even allowing protected resources to unfurl. Another powerful capability is initiating interactive workflows from the mere mention of a link.
