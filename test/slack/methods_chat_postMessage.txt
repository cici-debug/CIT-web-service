								Formatting
						Node:

								Messages are formatted as described in the

								link_names
								to change formatting behavior.
						Node:

								The optional

								argument should contain a JSON-encoded array of attachments.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For more information, see the
							Element:a
								attachments spec
								. If you're using a

								Slack app
								, you can also use this method to attach
							Element:a
								message buttons
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								By default links to media are unfurled, but links to text content are not. For more information on the differences and how to control this, see the
							Element:a
								the unfurling documentation
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2

								Use the

								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For best results, limit the number of characters in the
							Element:code
								text
								field to a few thousand characters at most. Ideally, messages should be short and human-readable, if you need to post longer messages, please consider
							Element:a
								uploading a snippet instead
								. (The absolute maximum number of characters allowed in a single message is 4000.)

								Authorship
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								How message authorship is attributed varies by a few factors, with some behaviors varying depending on the kinds of tokens you're using to post a message.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The best way to realize your intended result is to be explicit with the
							Element:code
								as_user
								parameter.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:code
								chat.postMessage
								wants your message posting to succeed and may attempt to guess the most appropriate
							Element:code
								as_user
								interpretation based on the kind of token you're using.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If
							Element:code
								as_user
								is not provided at all, then the value is inferred, based on the scopes granted to the caller: If the caller
							Element:em
								could
								post with
							Element:code
								as_user
								passed as
							Element:code
								false
								, then that is how the method behaves; otherwise, the method behaves as if
							Element:code
								as_user
								were passed as
							Element:code
								true
								.
