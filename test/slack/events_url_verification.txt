					Verifies ownership of an Events API Request URL
			Node:

				Element:p
					This Events API-only event type has no "inner event". Instead, the complete payload you'll receive is similar to this JSON:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					{ "token": "Jhj5dZrVaK7ZwHHjRyZWjbDl", "challenge": "3eZbrw1aBm2rZgRNFdxV2595E9CY3gmdALWMmHkvFXO7tYXAYM8P", "type": "url_verification" }
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					This event does not require a specific OAuth scope or subscription. You'll automatically receive it whenever configuring an
				Element:a
					Events API
					Request URL.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Once you receive the event, respond in plaintext with the
				Element:code
					challenge
					attribute value. In this example, that might be:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					HTTP 200 OK Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded 3eZbrw1aBm2rZgRNFdxV2595E9CY3gmdALWMmHkvFXO7tYXAYM8P
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Alternatively, you can respond with
				Element:code
					application/x-www-form-urlencoded
					:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					HTTP 200 OK Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded challenge=3eZbrw1aBm2rZgRNFdxV2595E9CY3gmdALWMmHkvFXO7tYXAYM8P
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Or even JSON:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					HTTP 200 OK Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded {"challenge":"3eZbrw1aBm2rZgRNFdxV2595E9CY3gmdALWMmHkvFXO7tYXAYM8P"}
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Please verify that the
				Element:code
					token
					value found in the payload matches your application's configured Slack token.
