								App name
						Node:

							Element:p
								A great name can evoke the experience of what it's like to use your app. Choose a name that's easy to remember, say, search for, and spell (so, sadly, no emojis). Maybe something sassy.

																	Tips
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:ul
																Element:li
																	Use active voice and speak to users directly. (Speaking in a passive voice makes sentences weaker.)
																Element:li
																	Make your long description easier to read with simple markdown.
																Element:li
																	Don't stuff your description with keywords — it's distracting and won't help your app's discoverability.

								App Icon
						Node:

								Your app icon should catch people's eye — or stop their thumb — when they're scrolling through the directory. Make it unique, distinctive, and simple enough to pass the squint test.

																Element:li
																	Please don't submit something that resembles Slack's logo or Slackbot.
																Element:li
																	Your icon should be 512x512px or bigger and have a full-bleed background.

						Node:

								You can say a lot by creating a screencast with minimal editing, or you can go full-production with animation. How you tell your story is up to you.
						Node:

								Whichever direction you take, be sure to tell people how your app works, who it's for, and what they can accomplish with it within Slack.

																Element:ul
																Element:li
																	Keep it short and sweet: somewhere between 30-90 seconds is a good rule of thumb.
																Element:li
																	Your video will need to be a publicly-accessible YouTube link, not a link to a channel or playlist.
																Element:li
																	Make sure to turn on closed captioning and turn off ads in YouTube's settings before submitting your link.
																Element:li
																	Show your app specifically in the context of Slack's UI.

						Node:

								Your app has a profile inside Slack, just like people do. When you upload your app to the directory, you can pick a color that reflects your brand. It's like your app's aura.

																	Pick a color that complements your app icon, since it'll be shown behind it in your app profile within the Slack client.
																Element:li
																	Choose a color that works well with white text. So everyone can see your app's plumage.
