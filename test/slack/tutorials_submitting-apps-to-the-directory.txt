					This guide covers how to submit your app to the Slack App Directory. If you haven't yet built your Slack app but are curious about how to do so, head over to see our

					about building a Slack app.

					Please note that your app does not need to be listed in the App Directory for it to work, so no need to submit any apps used only by your team.

					It's Monday again and everyone's excited to jump into Slack and use the new Slack app you've built. It's been helping your team be more productive and everyone's talking about what a difference it's made. So you start to wonder, maybe there are other Slack teams who would find it just as handy as your team does?
			Node:

					Luckily, you see the Slack App Directory is just the place to share your app with other teams who might also benefit from using it. After spending weeks writing and testing your app, you're ready to submit it to the Slack App Directory. You're excited at the thought that just a week from now,
				Element:strong
					your app will be published and searchable in the App Directory
					(conditions may vary depending on temperature, humidity level, and any feedback the review team has for you).
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Since you know you might be out of the office when the review team gets back to you, you also
				Element:strong
					add one of your Slack team members as a collaborator on the app
					, allowing them to check in on the submission and make any changes necessary during and after the review process. Yay teamwork! (Learn more about
				Element:a
					App Collaborators

								To get started, you click on the "

								api.slack.com/apps
								.
						Node:
						(type) c

								This opens the
							Element:strong
								Submission Checklist
								, which gives you a detailed list of items looked at during the review (here's an

								overview
								. These are some of the most common areas of failure during the review, so you read through the checklist carefully, to make sure that you follow each item.
						Node:

							Element:p
								Before you submit everything, you also install your app from scratch on a new Slack team, just to make sure everything's in tip-top shape and working as it should be.

											Once you've completed the checklist

											This gives you the chance to

											Once you're happy with your submission, and you've read through all the checklist items carefully, you get the satisfaction of hitting the Submit button twice in a row! Twice! (If you find you need to change something in your app while it's in the review process, just head back over to your app and hit the "Keep editing" button to remove it from the review and edit it.)

								Now that your app's submitted, you keep your fingers crossed, make a cup of the beverage of your choice and start building your next Slack app (your team needs easy access to their Star Trek gifs). Typing with your fingers crossed is a little difficult though so you decide to take your new puppy for a walk in the park instead.

											"Publish"

									Node:

											Your app should be live before your blog post and tweets, so you take a deep breath and you hit "Publish". Congratulations, your app's in the App Directory! Now your future customers can find your app from the search bar at slack.com/apps. Time to get the wheels turning on the marketing plan.

								Your app's in the App Directory, meeting new Slack teams and you've uncovered a way to add more sparkle to your app's functionality. It's time to update your app's description (we understand, we like âœ¨).
						Node:

								Submitting updates to the Slack-side configuration of your app will send your app back to the Review Team before you can publish changes to the live version
								. When you'd like to make changes for the first time, you'll create a development copy of your app using the "Edit App" option, which allows you to make changes to test and submit without affecting your live App Directory app.

								And, voilÃ , here's your development copy! Now you can see all
							Element:strong
								your development app's settings
								, from
							Element:code
								Basic Information
								to the Event Subscriptions section. Perhaps you'll add a bot user to your app in the "Bot Users" section.

								After you create the Slack button for your development app, you'll be able to add the

						Node:

								You'll notice that, along with the settings for your development app, you also have two new sections in your app's configuration pages:

								The "Live App Settings" section
								shows you the Client ID and Client Secret for your live app. You also find a handy "Show My App in the App Directory" toggle in case you ever need to remove your app from the App Directory.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Imagine, one day a few months from now, you find there's a small bug in the onboarding process for your new bot. You don't want new users finding the app while it's not working quite as it should be, so you'd like to remove it from the App Directory temporarily. Just
							Element:strong
								toggle the "Show My App in the App Directory" option
								to hide it for now.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once you've fixed that bug and are happy that everything's working you can go back to your Live App Settings to show the app in the App Directory again.
						Node:
						(type) c

								The
							Element:strong
								"Update App Directory App"
								section allows you to submit the changes you've made in your development app settings for review before you publish those changes to your live app.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once again, you have control of when you publish those updates to your app once they've passed the review. When you click through to your app from
							Element:a
								https://api.slack.com/apps
								(or from the email notification link) you'll be met with
							Element:strong
								another shiny green "Publish" button
								.

								The Finishing Touches
						Node:

								With your app in the App Directory and performing well with the great functionality you've added, you're ready to see it as a featured app. The App Directory team looks out for great apps to feature during the review process, so you make sure your app stands out.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The app installation page is the first impression customers will have of your app so you ensure the page is clear and nicely designed, with lots of helpful information about your app and what it does. Think of this as the landing page where your app can shine: a place to give users important details about how to install and use your app.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You take another look at your app's onboarding to make sure that it helpfully guides users through from installation to first use, providing helpful information without being bothersome. You also provide a helpful support page where users can get in touch with you if they have any questions.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Overall, your app is helpful, but not intrusive; well designed, but simple; and will make a team's working life simpler, more pleasant, and more productive. This is exactly what the App Directory team looks for.
