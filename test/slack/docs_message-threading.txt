								Forking conversations
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A channel or DM conversation is a nearly linear timeline of messages exchanged between people, bots, and apps. When one of these messages is replied to, it becomes the parent of a thread. By default, threaded replies do not appear directly in the channel, instead relegated to a kind of forked timeline descending from the parent message.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Even though Slack clients treat replies this way, messages are delivered the same old way over
							Element:a
								RTM
								,
							Element:a
								Events API
								, or methods like
							Element:a
								. Easily identify & differentiate parent messages and replies — everything is thoughtfully marked.

											Recognize threaded messages by looking for a

										Element:li
											Identify replies by noting when a threaded message's

											and
										Element:code
											thread_ts
											values
										Element:em
											differ
											. If they're
										Element:em

										Element:li
											Attach your messages to a thread by specifying another message's
										Element:code
											ts
											value as your reply's
										Element:code
											thread_ts
											.
										Element:li
											When responding to a message that's part of a thread, you should keep your responses

										Element:li
											When responding to a non-threaded message, consider creating a thread by replying to the message inciting your response.

														Message threads may have only one parent, they can only fork once.

														Replies can't spawn from replies and must tie back to a single originating message.

														Parent messages may have zero or any number of replies.
													Element:li
														Threaded messages can be found in channels, private channels, group messages, and direct messages.
													Element:li
														Users may "subscribe" to specific threads, but their subscriptions have no effect on whether threaded messages are sent via the RTM or Events APIs.
													Element:li
														Replies are presented chronologically in the Web API, Events API, and RTM API, just like any old message.
													Element:li
														Your app needs to parse
													Element:code
														thread_ts
														fields to understand whether a message is part of a thread.
													Element:li
														To retain continuity, your bot's responses to in-thread invocations should

								If receiving some kind of invocation (like a keyword or an @mention)
							Element:em
								within
								a threaded message, your bot user should respond within the same thread by specifying its
							Element:code
								thread_ts
								.
							Element:li
								Don't specify a message that is already a reply's
							Element:code
								ts
								value as a new message's
							Element:code
								thread_ts
								. Specify the parent message.
							Element:li
								Tactfully use
							Element:code
								reply_broadcast
								when your bot's reply is useful for everyone in a channel. Keep in mind these broadcast replies will not contain the message's attachments or message buttons, but instead as a
							Element:em
								reference to
								your bot's actual message.
							Element:li
								Consider moving your multi-step workflows to a thread format, still "public" but contained in a forked conversation.

							Element:code
								thread_ts
								that is equal to this
							Element:code
								ts
								value, the message is the parent of a thread and may contain zero or more
							Element:code
								replies
								. When replying to a parent message, this
							Element:code
								ts
								value is used for the
							Element:code
								thread_ts
							Element:em
								parameter
								.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								thread_ts
							Element:td
								string
							Element:td
