					If you parse events referencing
				Element:a
					files
					in the
				Element:a
					real-time messaging API
					, you may have noticed we send a sometimes comically large packet of information when streaming nearly anything related to a file.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					To improve performance and provide a better user experience, we're reducing the payload of most file-related events in the RTM API to include only the file's ID. You'll need to use the
				Element:a
					API method to retrieve additional information about files.
				Element:code
					files.info
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					These changes will roll out gradually beginning May 16th, 2016 â€” read below to understand how this change may effect you, especially if you work with bot users.

					Bot users
					will gain comparable capabilities, allowing bot user tokens to work with
				Element:code
					files.info
					based on the channel memberships and related capabilities granted to them.

											How these events will change
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											After release, you will receive abbreviated
										Element:code
											file
											events, with only the
										Element:code
											id
											attribute:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											{ "file_id": "F2147483862", "type": "file_shared", "file": { "id": "F2147483862" } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This
										Element:code
											id
											value may be used with the
										Element:a
											API method to obtain fresh information about the file it represents. We'll also include a top-level
										Element:code
											files.info
										Element:code
											file_id
											field, which you may want to use going forward instead.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Until now, these events would have had more verbose file details included:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											{ "type": "file_shared", "file": { "id" : "F2147483862", "created" : 1356032811, "timestamp" : 1356032811, "name" : "file.htm", "title" : "My HTML file", "mimetype" : "text\/plain", "filetype" : "text", "pretty_type": "Text", "user" : "U2147483697", "mode" : "hosted", "editable" : true, "is_external": false, "external_type": "", "username": "", "size" : 12345, "url_private": "https:\/\/slack.com\/files-pri\/T024BE7LD-F024BERPE\/1.png", "url_private_download": "https:\/\/slack.com\/files-pri\/T024BE7LD-F024BERPE\/download\/1.png", "thumb_64": "https:\/\/slack-files.com\/files-tmb\/T024BE7LD-F024BERPE-c66246\/1_64.png", "thumb_80": "https:\/\/slack-files.com\/files-tmb\/T024BE7LD-F024BERPE-c66246\/1_80.png", "thumb_360": "https:\/\/slack-files.com\/files-tmb\/T024BE7LD-F024BERPE-c66246\/1_360.png", "thumb_360_gif": "https:\/\/slack-files.com\/files-tmb\/T024BE7LD-F024BERPE-c66246\/1_360.gif", "thumb_360_w": 100, "thumb_360_h": 100, "thumb_480": "https:\/\/slack-files.com\/files-tmb\/T024BE7LD-F024BERPE-c66246\/1_480.png", "thumb_480_w": 480, "thumb_480_h": 480, "thumb_160": "https:\/\/slack-files.com\/files-tmb\/T024BE7LD-F024BERPE-c66246\/1_160.png", "permalink" : "https:\/\/tinyspeck.slack.com\/files\/cal\/F024BERPE\/1.png", "permalink_public" : "https:\/\/tinyspeck.slack.com\/T024BE7LD-F024BERPE-3f9216b62c", "edit_link" : "https:\/\/tinyspeck.slack.com\/files\/cal\/F024BERPE\/1.png/edit", "preview" : "&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;meta charset='utf-8'&gt;", "preview_highlight" : "&lt;div class=\"sssh-code\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"sssh-line\"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html...", "lines" : 123, "lines_more": 118, "is_public": true, "public_url_shared": false, "display_as_bot" : false, "channels": ["C024BE7LT", ...], "groups": ["G12345", ...], "ims": ["D12345", ...], "initial_comment": {...}, "num_stars": 7, "is_starred": true, "pinned_to": ["C024BE7LT", ...], "reactions": [ { "name": "astonished", "count": 3, "users": [ "U1", "U2", "U3" ] }, { "name": "facepalm", "count": 1034, "users": [ "U1", "U2", "U3", "U4", "U5" ] } ], "comments_count": 1 } }

											Bot users
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Today, some bot users may rely on the current behavior to utilize or index files referenced in the channels they belong to. To support that use case, we will improve the
										Element:code
											files.info
											method to make it accessible to bot users and scoped only to the files that a bot has access to when using its bot user token.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											We'll post a follow up within the next two weeks when we're ready to release these new capabilities.

								How to prepare:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Review your streaming integration to determine where and when you rely on the full file object being present in events. If you don't need the full file object, consume only the file ID. If you need the full file object, request it using
							Element:code
								files.info
								.

								We want to make these improvements as soon as possible, beginning a gradual roll out on May 16th, 2016. If you believe that your application, custom integration, or third party library will outright break or non-gracefully degrade as a result of this change,
							Element:a
								please let us know immediately
								so we may work together to make this transition as seamless as possible.
