					The
				Element:code
					id
					field is a string identifier for this team member. It is only unique to the team containing the user. Use this field instead of the
				Element:code
					name
					field when storing related data or when specifying the user in API requests. Though the ID field usually begins with
				Element:code
					U
					, it is also possible to encounter user IDs beginning with
				Element:code
					W
					. We recommend considering the string an opaque value.

					The profile hash contains as much information as the user has supplied in the default profile fields:
				Element:code
					first_name
					,
				Element:code
					last_name
					,
				Element:code
					real_name
					,
				Element:code
					email
					,
				Element:code
					skype
					, and the
				Element:code
					image_*
					fields. Only the
				Element:code
					image_*
					fields are guaranteed to be included. Data that has not been supplied may not be present at all, may be null or may contain the empty string (""). Please note that custom profile fields are not yet available through the API.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The
				Element:code

			Node:

					The
				Element:code
					has_2fa
					field describes whether two-step verification is enabled for this user. This field will always be displayed if you are looking at your own user information. If you are looking at another user's information this field will only be displayed if you are Team Admin or owner.

					The

					Bot users may contain a

					always_active
					field under
				Element:code
					profile
					, indicating whether the bot user is active in a way that overrides traditional presence rules. The

					docs tell the whole story.

								Enterprise Grid user objects
						Node:

							Element:p
								Users belonging to an Enterprise Grid workspace have a
							Element:code
								enterprise_team
								node attached containing these fields:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:code
								id
								- this user's ID, which might start with
							Element:code
								U
								or
							Element:code
								W
								; IDs beginning with
							Element:code
								U
								are unique only to a team/workspace. IDs beginning with
							Element:code
								W
								are unique for an entire Enterprise Grid organization and may represent the user on multiple teams within it.
							Element:li
							Element:code
								enterprise_id
								- the unique ID for this particular Enterprise Organization
							Element:li
							Element:code
								enterprise_name
								- the name of this umbrella organization
							Element:li
							Element:code
								is_admin
								- a boolean value indicating whether this user administers this enterprise
							Element:li
							Element:code
								is_owner
								- a boolean value indicating whether this user is the owner of this enterprise
							Element:li
							Element:code
								teams
								- an array of team IDs within the containing enterprise that the user is a member of
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Some enterprise grid users also have a kind of dual identity â€” a local team-centric user ID beginning with
							Element:code
								U
								as well as a enterprise
							Element:em
								wide
								user ID beginning with
							Element:code
								W
								, called the enterprise user ID.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In most cases these IDs can be used interchangeably but we strongly prefer using the enterprise user ID whenever possible.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Whenever possible, when working against an enterprise and calling a method that references user IDs with dual mappings, we'll provide a helpful hash called
							Element:code
								user_id_mapping_old_to_new
								:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								"user_id_mapping_old_to_new": { "U2EBP618A": "W1ABCD23E", "U1ABCD23E": "W2ES6VB5Y" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Use these mappings to permanently update your records.

						(type) c
