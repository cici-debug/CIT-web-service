					This method allows you to exchange a temporary OAuth

					code
					for an API access token. This is used as part of the

					As discussed
				Element:a
					in RFC 6749
					it is possible to supply the Client ID and Client Secret using the HTTP Basic authentication scheme. If HTTP Basic authentication is used you do not need to supply the

					client_id
					and
				Element:code
					client_secret
					parameters as part of the request.

							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								invalid_arg_name
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was passed an argument whose name falls outside the bounds of common decency. This includes very long names and names with non-alphanumeric characters other than
							Element:code
								_
								. If you get this error, it is typically an indication that you have made a
							Element:em
								very
								malformed API call.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								invalid_array_arg
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was passed a PHP-style array argument (e.g. with a name like
							Element:code
								foo[7]
								). These are never valid with the Slack API.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								invalid_charset

								The method was called via a

								Content-Type
								header was invalid. Valid charset names are:

								The method was called via a

								Description
							Element:tr

								missing_charset
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was called via a
							Element:code
								POST
								request, and recommended practice for the specified
							Element:code
								Content-Type
								is to include a
							Element:code
								charset
								parameter. However, no
							Element:code
								charset
								was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g.
							Element:code
								text/plain
								) are the ones for which
							Element:code
								charset
								is recommended.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								superfluous_charset
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was called via a
							Element:code
								POST
								request, and the specified
							Element:code
								Content-Type
								is not defined to understand the
							Element:code
								charset
								parameter. However,
							Element:code
								charset
								was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g.
							Element:code
								multipart/form-data
								) are the ones for which
							Element:code
								charset
								is superfluous.
