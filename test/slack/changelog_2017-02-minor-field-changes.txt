					Ever notice how the
				Element:code
					username
					field of a file object in
				Element:a
					or
				Element:code
					channels.history
				Element:a
					event isn't like typical username fields and contains a bunch of markup usually reserved only for message text?
				Element:code
					file_share
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					And why is there a top-level
				Element:code
					skype
					field in user profile objects when
				Element:em
					really
					, shouldn't that be a custom field?
			Node:

				Element:p
					Well,
				Element:em
					we've
					noticed. And so...

								Instead of seeing funky strings like
							Element:code
								<U123456:tomatotude>
								in the
							Element:code
								username
								field of file-related messages in
							Element:a
								and file-related events in the
							Element:code
								channels.history
							Element:a
								Events
								&
							Element:a
								RTM API
								APIs, you'll instead encounter just plain old
							Element:code
								tomatotude
								â€” because that's the username. If you want the user ID, you can fetch it from the
							Element:code
								user
								field just like any other message.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								skype
								field in
							Element:a
								user
								profile data will begin appearing as a blank string:
							Element:code
								""
								. For teams with this profile field set today, you'll find that value in the custom profile fields configured for that team. If you attempt to set the
							Element:code
								skype
								field via
							Element:a
								, your request will technically succeed but the provided value will be stubbornly ignored.
							Element:code
								users.profile.set

								The

								In the rare case that you've customized behavior to deal with this
							Element:code
								username
								anomaly, you may need to adjust your behavior to treat it like a typical

								username
								field again.

								If your app relies on a team's populated
							Element:code
								skype
								field, you'll need to look for it as part of the user's profile available in expanded user objects and with

								.
