								for unnamed files.
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								created
								property is a unix timestamp representing when the file was created. The
							Element:code
								timestamp
								property is deprecated and is provided only for backwards compatibility with older clients. The
							Element:code
								updated
								property (for Post filetypes only) is a unix timestamp of when the Post was last edited.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								mimetype
								and
							Element:code
								filetype
								props do not have a 1-to-1 mapping, as multiple different files types ('html', 'js', etc.) share the same mime type. The
							Element:code
								pretty_type
								property contains a human-readable version of the type.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The

								property contains one of
							Element:code

								or
							Element:code
								post
								.
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								editable
								property indicates that files are stored in editable mode. The
							Element:code
								is_external
								property indicates whether the master copy of a file is stored within the system or not. If the file
							Element:code
								is_external
								, then the
							Element:code
								url
								property will point to the externally-hosted master file. Further, the
							Element:code
								external_type
								property will indicate what kind of external file it is, e.g.
							Element:code
								dropbox
								or
							Element:code
								gdoc
								.
						Node:

								The

								parameter, which includes headers to force a browser download. Both

								Authorization: Bearer A_VALID_TOKEN
						Node:
						(type) c

						Node:

								prop.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The

								thumb_80
								prop (when present) contains the URL of an 80x80 thumb. Unlike the 64px thumb, this size is guaranteed to be 80x80, even when the source image was smaller (it's padded with transparent pixels).
						Node:

								A variable sized thumb will be returned as

								.
						Node:

								The

						Node:

								The
							Element:code
								reactions
								property contains any reactions that have been added to the file and gives information about the type of reaction, the total number of users who added that reaction and a (possibly incomplete) list of users who have added that reaction to the file. The users array in the
							Element:code
								reactions
								property might not always contain all users that have reacted (we limit it to X users, and X might change), however
							Element:code
								count
								will always represent the count of all users who made that reaction (i.e. it may be greater than
							Element:code
								users.length
								).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2

								If the authenticated user has a given reaction then they are guaranteed to appear in the

								or not.
						Node:

								The
