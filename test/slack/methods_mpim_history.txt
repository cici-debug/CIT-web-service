								The

								messages
								array up to 100 messages between
							Element:code
								latest
								and
							Element:code

								. If there were more than 100 messages between those two points, then

						Node:

								If a message has the same timestamp as
							Element:code
								latest
								or
							Element:code
								oldest
								it will not be included in the list, unless
							Element:code
								inclusive
								is true. This allows a client to fetch all messages in a hole in channel history, by calling channels.history with
							Element:code
								latest
								set to the oldest message they have after the hole, and
							Element:code
								oldest
								to the latest message they have before the hole. If the response includes
							Element:code
								has_more
								then the client can make another call, using the
							Element:code
								ts
								value of the final messages as the
							Element:code
								latest
								param to get the next page of messages.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If there are more than 100 messages between the two timestamps then the messages returned are the ones closest to
							Element:code
								latest
								. In most cases an application will want the most recent messages and will page backward from there. If
							Element:code
								oldest
								is provided but not
							Element:code
								latest
								then the messages returned are those closest to
							Element:code
								oldest
								, allowing you to page forward through history if desired.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Messages of type
							Element:code
								"message"
								are user-entered text messages sent to the multiparty direct message channel, while other types are events that happened within the multiparty direct message channel. All messages have both a
							Element:code
								type
								and a sortable
							Element:code
								ts
								, but the other fields depend on the
							Element:code
								type
								. For a list of all possible events, see the
							Element:a
								channel messages
								documentation.
						Node:

							Element:p
								If a message has been starred by the calling user, the

								is_starred
								property will be present and true. This property is only added for starred items, so is not present in the majority of messages.
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								is_limited
								boolean property is only included for free teams that have reached the free message limit. If true, there are messages before the current result set, but they are beyond the message limit.

								The method was passed an argument whose name falls outside the bounds of common decency. This includes very long names and names with non-alphanumeric characters other than

								missing_charset
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was called via a

								POST
								request, and recommended practice for the specified

								Content-Type
								is to include a
							Element:code
								charset
								parameter. However, no

								charset
								was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g.
							Element:code
								text/plain
								) are the ones for which
							Element:code
								charset
								is recommended.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								superfluous_charset
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was called via a
							Element:code
								POST
								request, and the specified
							Element:code
								Content-Type
								is not defined to understand the
							Element:code
								charset
								parameter. However,
							Element:code
								charset
								was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g.
							Element:code
								multipart/form-data
								) are the ones for which
							Element:code
								charset
								is superfluous.
