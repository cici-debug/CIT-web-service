					Our goal is for Slack to be a safe and pleasant working environment for teams that use Slack. Apps are an important component to making Slack useful and in helping teams be productive. We will remove Apps that we consider to be inappropriate for use in the workplace or that negatively impact the user experience on Slack. We reserve the right to remove or refuse any app that contains content that we believe violates the letter or spirit of these guidelines. Please review the following carefully.
