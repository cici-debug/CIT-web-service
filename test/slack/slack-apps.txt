											The chart below describes the states that a Slack app can be and how they flow to one another.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Slack apps begin their life void of features, uninstalled. Waiting for you to fill them with potential and functionality. We hope you move your app through the first two stages. Unless you're developing for other teams, stages three and four are optional. We're happy you're developing on Slack at all stages.

														1. Your app begins void of features, uninstalled
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:blockquote
													Element:p
														Just after you create your Slack app, it's not really capable of much. You probably haven't begun coding. You haven't declared the platform features you plan to use in the app, like
													Element:a
														incoming webhooks
														or a
													Element:a
														bot user
														.
													Element:p
														It's an empty vessel somehow full with limitless potential. After you add features to your app, you'll make it installable.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:h4
														2. Your app has features but can only be installed by your team
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:blockquote
													Element:p
														By default, newly created Slack apps will begin in this state. This might be the end of the lifecycle for your app. If you only ever need your own team to install your app, progress no further. This stage can be your lifelong home.
													Element:p
														Your app can either use the button-based installation available in your application management console
													Element:em
														or
														you can use OAuth 2.0. Rest assured, your app can only be installed on your team either way.
													Element:p
														When you add or remove new Slack app features, you'll need to install your app again.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:h4
														3. Your app is open to installation by other teams
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:blockquote
													Element:p
													Element:em
														This step is
														. It's entirely possible you'll never want another team to ever install your app.
													Element:strong
														completely
														optional
													Element:p
														By setting your app to this state, other teams will be able to use OAuth 2.0 to install or sign in to your app -- all they'll need is your client ID and for you to have done all the work to support OAuth.
													Element:p
														For historical reasons, apps created before February 28th, 2017 will already be in this state. Feel free to lock your app down to just your team, returning to the comforts of stage 2. See
													Element:a
														your old apps
														for more information.
													Element:p
														Slack apps open to installation by other teams have additional security requirements: your OAuth redirect URIs, interactive message action URLs, slash command invocation URLs, and Events API delivery locations must all support SSL.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
												Node:

														4. Your app is submitted to and/or part of the Slack app directory
												Node:

												(layer)4
													Element:blockquote
													Element:p
													Element:em
														This step is also
														. Becoming part of the directory is a very deliberate undertaking.
													Element:strong
														completely
														optional
													Element:p
														Once your app is submitted or part of the directory, you are granted a "development" version of your Slack app with its own dedicated Client ID and secret and installations. You'll need to re-submit your app for approval again whenever you change app-related items like the name, icon, authorization settings, or Slack app features.

																	With the

																	By requesting the
																Element:code
																	incoming-webhook
																	scope, users can grant your app access to post messages to a Slack channel of their choice, just like a custom incoming webhook integration.
																Element:li
																	By requesting the
																Element:code
																	commands
																	scope, authenticated users will have access to any commands that you have configured in your app.
																Element:li
																	By requesting the
																Element:code
																	bot
																	scope, you will receive a bot user token upon completion of an OAuth flow. You can use this bot user token to connect to the
																Element:a
																	Real Time Messaging API
																	.
																Element:li
																	By requesting other granular object scopes, like
																Element:code
