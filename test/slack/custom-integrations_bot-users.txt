					What are bot users?
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Bot users have many of the same qualities as their human counterparts: they have profile photos, names, and bios, they exist in the team directory, they can be direct messaged or mentioned, they can post messages and upload files, and they can be invited to and kicked out of channels and private groups.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The biggest difference between bot users and regular users is that instead of interacting with a team via one of Slack's mobile or desktop apps, bot users are controlled programmatically via a bot user token that accesses one or more of Slack's APIs.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Bot users can't "log in," they don't have a password, and they only have access to a
				Element:a
					subset
					of all of the API methods available to regular users.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Within a Slack channel, bot users can do nearly anything you can program them to do.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Slack has two different kinds of bot users: custom bots and
				Element:a
					app bots
					. Each serves a different purpose and offers different functionality. This document concerns custom bots. To build an app bot, build a
				Element:a
					Slack app
					.

								Custom bot users
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Every team has the ability to create their own custom bot users that they can use on their team. They do this by going to their team's settings page and
							Element:a
								creating a new bot user
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2

								Custom bot users are useful for when you want to build something custom for your own team, and have no interest in distributing it to other teams.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For example: you may want to do something very specific like send out an HR survey with a special link out to everyone at your company, or a way to listen for mentions of your company's dog mascot and post cute pictures whenever someone mentions his or her name.

					What can bot users do?
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The primary way bot users interact with people on a given team is by connecting to the
				Element:a
					Real Time Messaging API
					(RTM API for short) and opening up a websocket connection with Slack.

											Monitor and process channel activity
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This websocket will send you all of the messages and activity that happen in public and private channels that the bot user is invited to, as well as messages that are sent to it via direct message. A bot user opens this websocket with the RTM API by sending an authenticated call to the
										Element:a
											API method. To learn more about connecting to the RTM API,
										Element:code
											rtm.start
										Element:a
											read the documentation here

									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In addition to receiving messages and activity in the channels it belongs to, the RTM API can be used to post messages as well. However, the RTM API only supports posting messages in our
										Element:a
											default message formatting
											. It doesn't support attachments or other message formatting modes.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To post more complex messages as a bot user, clients can use the Web API method
										Element:a
											.
										Element:code
											chat.postMessage
										Element:strong
											Be sure and set
											and use your bot user token.
										Element:code
											as_user
											to
										Element:code
											true
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The bot user can also use the Web API to
										Element:a
											add emoji reactions
											to messages,
										Element:a
											upload files
											,
										Element:a
											pin
											and
										Element:a
											star
											messages, and generally behave like any other user on the team.

					How do I create custom bot users for my team?
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Start by creating a
				Element:a
					new bot user integration
					. You'll need to pick a username for your new bot. Bot usernames can be up to 21 characters long and sorry, you can't name your bot
				Element:code
					Slackbot
					. Additionally, your bot username cannot be the same name as one of your team's channels.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Once you've added the integration to your team, you'll be granted a
				Element:a
					bot access token
					, which you'll use when connecting to our APIs as that bot user.

				Element:p
					Creating bot users probably means you'll be coding. If you're using an existing library (such as
				Element:a
					node-slack-client
					) then your bot access token should be all you need to get started.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					If you're writing your own library from scratch, you'll need to write code to
				Element:a
					make authenticated API calls
					and consume our
				Element:a
					Real Time Messaging API
					. After building those basics, you can focus on the interesting functionality of your bot user.

					- Bot users do not follow the usual rules for automatically being

					marked as away when inactive
					. In most cases you want a bot user to display as "active" and ready to respond, even if it hasn't posted a message in a while. Use
