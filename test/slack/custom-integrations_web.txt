								Basics
						Node:

							Element:p
								The Web API consists of
							Element:a
								HTTP RPC-style methods
								, all of the form
							Element:code
								https://slack.com/api/METHOD
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								All methods must be called using HTTPS. Arguments can be passed as GET or POST params, or a mix. The response contains a JSON object, which will always contain a top-level boolean property
							Element:code
								ok
								, indicating success or failure. For failure results, the
							Element:code
								error
								property will contain a short machine-readable error code. In the case of problematic calls that could still be completed successfully,
							Element:code
								ok
								will be
							Element:code
								true
								and the
							Element:code
								warning
								property will contain a short machine-readable warning code (or comma-separated list of them, in the case of multiple warnings).

								Authentication
						Node:

							Element:p
								Authenticate your Web API requests by providing a bearer token, which identifies a single user.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								While developing or testing your app, you may use test tokens using our
							Element:a
								test token generator
								. We don't recommend using test tokens in your custom integrations. Build a
							Element:a
								Slack app
								just for your team instead and scope permissions appropriately.

								Test tokens are just for you
								. Never share test tokens with other users or applications. Do not publish test tokens in public code repositories.
