											Until now, it's been easy to accidentally send messages flush with hundreds of
										Element:a
											message attachments
											. We've begun limiting the number of message attachments per message to 100. For approaches like
										Element:a
											,
										Element:code
											chat.postMessage
										Element:a
											incoming webhooks
											, and
										Element:a
											, and
										Element:code
											chat.update
										Element:code
											response_urls
											you will receive a
										Element:code
											too_many_attachments
											error. Unfortunately, we are unable to serve you an error when sending messages as part of a
										Element:a

											or
										Element:a

											Apps
											If you're interested in listing your Slack App in

											We've corrected a bug where
										Element:a
											incoming webhooks
											could post messages in "#general" even 1) if that channel restricts posts and 2) the user owning the webhook was not allowed to post there. This new behavior will only prevent recently created webhooks from posting to restricted "#general" channels, so if your old webhooks are relying on this quirk, they'll be fine for now.
