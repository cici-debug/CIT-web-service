					The
				Element:code
					team_migration_started
					event is sent when a Slack team is about to be migrated between servers.
				Element:strong
					The websocket connection will close immediately after it is sent.

					Occasionally we need to move Slack teams to a new server. To avoid any data synchronization bugs or race conditions we disconnect all clients from a team before starting this process. By the time a client has reconnected the process is usually complete, so the impact is minimal.

					When clients receive this event, immediately start a reconnection process by calling
				Element:a
					again. You may receive occasional
				Element:code
					rtm.start
				Element:code
					migration_in_progress
					errors when re-calling
				Element:code
					rtm.start
					. If this happens you should wait a few seconds and try again. If the error continues you should wait longer before retrying, and so on.
