								Introduction
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This is a demonstration of
							Element:a
								Slack's Event API
								using
							Element:a
								AWS Lambda
								to receive events and respond to specific messages. This demo looks for the words aws and lambda in a message. If found, it will respond by mentioning the sender and giving Lambda praises.

							Element:ul
							Element:li
								An

								AWS account
								with admin privileges
							Element:li
								An
							Element:a
								AWS Lambda
								function triggered by a url (Read
							Element:a
								this tutorial
								to find out how)
							Element:li
								A Slack App
							Element:a
								installed on a team
								with the
							Element:code
								channels:history
								and
							Element:code
								chat:write:bot
							Element:a
								OAuth scopes
								.

								Readying your app for the Events API
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Navigate to your
							Element:a
								Slack Apps
								and select the App you would like to use for subscriptions. If you don't have an App already, you can follow this guide to set one up.

								Configuring your Lambda Function
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Copy/paste the Lambda Function (provided above) into the Lambda function you created. Replace the following variables in the code with real data:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								[APP VERIFICATION TOKEN]
								- Replace with the Verification Token found at the bottom of your Slack App's OAuth & Permission Page https://api.slack.com/apps/A####XXXX/oauth
							Element:li
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								[SLACK ACCESS TOKEN]
								- The Slack access token used to post messages to Slack. This should have been collecting after installing the App to a team. [LINK TO TUTORIAL]
