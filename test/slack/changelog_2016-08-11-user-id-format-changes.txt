											Some user IDs may now begin with the letter "W"
									Node:

										Element:p
											Typically, user IDs encountered throughout the Slack platform begin with
										Element:code
											U
											. From now on, you may also encounter team members with a user ID beginning with
										Element:code
											W
											. Treat these user IDs just as you would those beginning with
										Element:code
											U
											.

											Some user objects may contain a new field
									Node:

										Element:p
											If your application or integration is installed by an Enterprise-enabled team, you may notice user objects containing a new field called
										Element:code
											enterprise_user
											. This field includes a hash of attributes describing that user's status as part of an enterprise organization.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											At this time, there's not much for developers to do with this field. We'll provide more detail on the meaning of each attribute in the coming weeks.

								What do I need to do to prepare?

								Most developers need do nothing at all. If you don't inspect the first character of the user ID string, everything should be all right. You also probably won't see user IDs beginning with
							Element:code
								W
								very often.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								But please do make sure that your code, database, and other plumbing all support user IDs beginning with the letter
							Element:code
								W
								, or any UTF-8 character.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Ideally, your code and business logic shouldn't contain any assumptions about the specific characters composing an ID.

								We

								our

								node-slack-sdk
								library to better handle some unfortunate assumptions we previously made.

								If you're the developer of a library, we recommend reviewing your code and ensuring these minor changes are compatible.
