			Node:

					We want to tell you even more about your API requests. On November 1st we'll begin including a
				Element:code
					response_metadata
					field in HTTP API responses.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					At first it will include a
				Element:code
					warnings
					array, just as the top-level JSON response does today. API warnings are great example of the kind of information we want to communicate in this response metadata, so please forgive our duplication.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Later we'll include a
				Element:code
					messages
					array. It will include human-readable descriptions of errors or warnings generated by your request.

								What's changing?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Today when you get a response that contains a warning, the response looks something like this:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "ok": true, "warnings": [ "missing_charset" ] }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When this change ships, that same response would look something like this:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "ok": true, "warnings": [ "missing_charset" ], "response_metadata": { "warnings": [ "missing_charset" ], } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								And then someday, we'll send wordy
							Element:code
								messages
								prepended with
							Element:code
								[WARN]
								and
							Element:code
								[ERROR]
								, like:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "ok": true, "warnings": [ "missing_charset" ], "response_metadata": { "warnings": [ "missing_charset" ], "messages": [ "[WARN] A Content-Type HTTP header was presented but did not declare a charset, such as a 'utf-8'" ] } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The above example message text is hypothetical and the actual text used in these messages will always be subject to change. We promise no knock knock jokes.

								How do I prepare?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Most developers need do nothing to prepare. You may want to verify that your code or libraries you use won't explode when encountering new fields and embedded data structures. Generally this is a non-issue for everyone.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you interpret the
							Element:code
								warnings
								we send today, you may want to relocate your consideration to the new
							Element:code
								warnings
								field descending from
							Element:code
								response_metadata
								.

								When is this happening?
						Node:

								We'd like to introduce this low risk change on November 1st, 2016.
