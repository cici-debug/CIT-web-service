						Node:

								fields can be up to 35 characters each. The name

								slackbot
								cannot be used for either of these fields.
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								email
								field must be a valid email address. It cannot have spaces, and it must have an
							Element:code
								@
								and a domain. It cannot be in use by another member of the same team. Changing a user's email address will send an email to both the old and new addresses, and also post a slackbot to the user informing them of the change. This field can only be changed for users on paid teams.

								After March 20, 2017 the

								The recommended way to set the profile image fields is to call

						Node:

							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								fields
								key is an array of key:value pairs holding the values for the user's custom profile fields. The key is the ID of the definition for that field, which is per-team. This ID can also be used in the
							Element:code
								name
								field of this method. The
							Element:code
								value
								of a field is what should be displayed, unless the
							Element:code
								alt
								key is also present, in which case that is displayed instead. The
							Element:code
								value
								can be up to 256 characters for fields of type
							Element:code
								text
								and
							Element:code
								link
								. For fields of type
							Element:code
								options_list
								, the
							Element:code
								value
								must be one of the
							Element:code
								possible_values
								in the field definition. For fields of type
							Element:code
								date
								, the
							Element:code
								value
								must be a valid date. The
							Element:code
								alt
								field can be up to 256 characters for all field types. The
							Element:code
								profile
								argument must be used in order to set the
							Element:code
								alt
								field.

								missing_charset

							Element:p
								The method was called via a

								Content-Type
								is to include a
							Element:code
								charset
								parameter. However, no

								was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g.

								text/plain
								) are the ones for which

								charset
								is recommended.

								superfluous_charset
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was called via a

								POST
								request, and the specified
							Element:code
								Content-Type
								is not defined to understand the
							Element:code
								charset
								parameter. However,
							Element:code
								charset
								was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g.
							Element:code
								multipart/form-data
								) are the ones for which
							Element:code

								is superfluous.
