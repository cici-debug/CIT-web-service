								Recently issued user tokens, bot user tokens, and test token strings will be longer than those you've typically encountered.

								Newer tokens will be at least twenty characters longer.
							Element:li
								We advise future-proofing your storage and anticipating tokens as long as 255 characters.

								How do I prepare?
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you store tokens in a database or other storage container, verify that you're ready for longer tokens. To best prepare for unknown futures, anticipate a string as long as 255 characters, such as the
							Element:code
								VARCHAR(255)
								or
							Element:code
								TINYTEXT
								data types.

								We strongly recommend not relying on any perceived semantics found in token strings.
