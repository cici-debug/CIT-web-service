											Sending messages
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Let's learn how to send this in-channel message as an incoming webhook:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											It's a simple, multi-line message without special formatting:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											This is a line of text. And this is another one.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The first step is to prepare this message as a key/value pair in JSON. For a simple message, your JSON payload only needs to define a
										Element:code
											text
											property, containing the text that will be posted to the channel.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In JSON, our message is defined as:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											{ "text": "This is a line of text.\nAnd this is another one." }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Please note that we indicated the line break as the control character
										Element:code
											\n
											. We also added additional whitespace for readability, which we could have more tidily presented to you as:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											{"text":"This is a line of text.\nAnd this is another one."}
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Once you've put together the JSON for your message, you can choose to send it to your Incoming Webhook URL one of two ways:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:h4
														Send it directly in JSON
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The preferred way to send Slack your JSON body is by sending a HTTP POST to your webhook URL, containing a request body with an explicit
													Element:code
														Content-type
														HTTP header set to
													Element:code
														application/json
														. This tells Slack how to interpret the data you're sending us.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Content-type: application/json { "text": "This is a line of text.\nAnd this is another one." }
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														By declaring the content type, no further encoding of the POST body is needed — just provide valid JSON in UTF-8.

									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:h4
														Send a JSON string within a parameter of a standard POST request
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														If you want to stick with the more traditional
													Element:code
														Content-type
														of
													Element:code
														application/x-www-form-urlencoded
														, you can sneakily send URL-escaped JSON within the
													Element:code
														payload
														parameter instead.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Send the
													Element:code
														payload
														parameter as part of your POST body and explicitly state the
													Element:code
														Content-type
														. Payloads should not be included as query parameters on the webhook URL.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The trickiest part of this approach is that you must properly
													Element:a
														URL encode
														your
													Element:code
														payload
														. Your elegant JSON message becomes seeming nonsense, filled with percent-encoded characters.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded payload=%7B%22text%22%3A%22This%20is%20a%20line%20of%20text.%5CnAnd%20this%20is%20another%20one.%22%7D
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Many HTTP clients provide convenient functions for URL encoding and setting the
													Element:code
														Content-type
														.

											will post a clickable link to https://slack.com.
									Node:

											To display hyperlinked text instead of the actual URL, use the pipe character, as shown in this example:
									Node:

										Element:code
											{ "text": "<https://alert-system.com/alerts/1234|Click here> for details!" }

											Incoming webhooks return more expressive errors than our Web API, including more relevant HTTP status codes (like "HTTP 400 Bad Request" and "HTTP 404 Not Found"). These changes are described in our changelog:

										Element:ul
										Element:li
										Element:code
											invalid_payload
											typically indicates that received request is malformed — perhaps the JSON is structured incorrectly, or the message text is not properly escaped. The request should not be retried without correction.
										Element:li
										Element:code
											user_not_found
											and
										Element:code
											channel_not_found
											indicate that the user or channel being addressed either do not exist or are invalid. The request should not be retried without modification or until the indicated user or channel is set up.
										Element:li
										Element:code
											channel_is_archived
											indicates the specified channel has been archived and is no longer accepting new messages.
										Element:li
										Element:code
											action_prohibited
											usually means that a team admin has placed some kind of restriction on this avenue of posting messages and that, at least for now, the request should not be attempted again.
										Element:li
										Element:code
											posting_to_general_channel_denied
											is thrown when an incoming webhook attempts to post to the "#general" channel for a team where posting to that channel is 1) restricted and 2) the creator of the same incoming webhook is not authorized to post there. You'll receive this error with a HTTP 403.
										Element:li
										Element:code
											too_many_attachments
											is thrown when an incoming webhook attempts to post a message with greater than 100 attachments. A message can have a maximum of 100 attachments associated with it.
