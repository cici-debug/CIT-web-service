					It's your Slack team. Your workspace. You want it to work with you. To work for you.
			Node:

				Element:p
					One way is to make integrations, bots, and other tools— just for your team. You can build
				Element:em

				Element:em
					for

								Internal integrations can do what Slack apps can do. Internal integrations

								Incoming webhooks
								provide the easiest way to send a message or notification. And you can make them interactive too. Perfect for cron jobs, batch scripts, or invoking from your internal bug trackers, build systems, and other process management tools.

								Bot users
								are a special kinds of users that observe & respond to conversational interactions in channels and direct messages. They are usually powered by a combination of the
							Element:a
								Web API
							Element:em
								and
								the
							Element:a
								Events API
								or the
							Element:a
								RTM API
								. Make work human again.

								Slash commands
								are triggered by users from within Slack. They're ideal for invoking actions like filing bug reports, initiating a deploy, or building ways to check in on the current health of your systems.
							Element:li
								The
							Element:a
								Web API
								is a collection of HTTP RPC
							Element:a
								methods
								for reading, writing, and transforming data and messages on Slack. You can do a little bit of everything and it's like the glue that binds a reasonably complex Slack app together.
							Element:li
								The
							Element:a
								Events
								and
							Element:a
								RTM
								APIs allow your app to receive data around a team in near real time. With the RTM API, your server opens a websocket connection with Slack and receives a firehose of data. With the Events API, Slack sends your server HTTP requests for each event you're subscribed to.

								When you're building just for your team, installing a Slack app is as easy clicking an install button. No one needs to learn OAuth if they don't want to.
						Node:

								Of course,

								OAuth
								is still here for you when you need it and you don't have to distribute your app to other teams to use it.

								What can you build?
						Node:

								It all depends on what your needs are. Use integrations to tie systems together, customize employee onboarding, reinforce cultural rituals, and send out those TPS reports everyone loves.

											SSL is recommended but not required
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											SSL is important, yes? Prevent all kinds of bad situations. But it does get in the way of developing locally or just sending a few requests to that server in the basement.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Accordingly, your internal integrations don't
										Element:em
											require
											SSL support on Events API request URLs, slash command invocations, interactive message action URLs, or OAuth redirect URLs.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you ever decide your app should be shared with another team — even another team that's part of your
										Element:a
											Enterprise Grid
											, you'll need to support SSL for all these things.
