							Element:p
								Authentication token is for a deleted user or team.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								invalid_arg_name
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was passed an argument whose name falls outside the bounds of common decency. This includes very long names and names with non-alphanumeric characters other than
							Element:code
								_
								. If you get this error, it is typically an indication that you have made a
							Element:em
								very
								malformed API call.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								invalid_array_arg
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was passed a PHP-style array argument (e.g. with a name like
							Element:code
								foo[7]
								). These are never valid with the Slack API.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								invalid_charset
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was called via a
							Element:code
								POST
								request, but the
							Element:code
								charset
								specified in the
							Element:code
								Content-Type
								header was invalid. Valid charset names are:
							Element:code
								utf-8
							Element:code
								iso-8859-1
								.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								invalid_form_data

								The method was called via a

								POST
								request with
							Element:code
								Content-Type
							Element:code
								application/x-www-form-urlencoded
								or
							Element:code
								multipart/form-data
								, but the form data was either missing or syntactically invalid.
							Element:tr
							Element:td

								invalid_post_type
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was called via a

								multipart/form-data
							Element:code
								text/plain
								.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code

								Warning
							Element:th
								Description
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								missing_charset
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was called via a
							Element:code
								POST
								request, and recommended practice for the specified
							Element:code
								Content-Type
								is to include a
							Element:code
								charset
								parameter. However, no
							Element:code
								charset
								was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g.
							Element:code
								text/plain
								) are the ones for which
							Element:code
								charset
								is recommended.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								superfluous_charset
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The method was called via a
							Element:code
								POST
								request, and the specified
							Element:code
								Content-Type
								is not defined to understand the
							Element:code
								charset
								parameter. However,
							Element:code
								charset
								was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g.
							Element:code
								multipart/form-data
								) are the ones for which
							Element:code
								charset
								is superfluous.
