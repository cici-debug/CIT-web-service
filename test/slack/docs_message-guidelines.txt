					Making your messages interactive with buttons allows you to provide more value to your users. It allows them to complete tasks quickly in the context of their conversation and workflow without having to navigate elsewhere.

								Stay in the Flow

								Interactions should focus on what team members are trying to do right then and there. Instead of offering many options, focus on the simple, common tasks that make sense to complete inside of Slack conversations.

								Making messages colorful
						Node:

								Colorful bars guarding the edge of messages and their components definitely make them more distinctive.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Use color bars a few ways: Utilize your brand color to complement your app's avatar to more clearly brand your messages. Your service may already associate specific colors with workflow transition types and objects â€” use the colors that will most clearly resonate with our common users.
						Node:
						(type) c

								When you're not harmonizing with your brand, we suggest using the default light gray. If you're looking for just a little more distinction, consider using optional

								warning

											If the destructive action is potentially catastrophic or may inspire a deep sense of regret, offer a clear confirmation step before proceeding.
									Node:

											Use non-default buttons sparingly.
											There should only be one non-default button per attachment to help users quickly identify what their options are.

								The life of an action
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								After a user takes an action, try to update the message to reflect the current state. This may mean replacing the buttons with a confirmation of what they've selected. You can do this but either updating the first message or removing it and sending a new one. Try to keep elements in place so users can quickly see what has changed. Also check that someone who is seeing this message later can understand what has happened.

								If there are multiple steps in an interaction, consider replacing the parts of the message and buttons along the way instead of just adding messages, and cleaning up the entire interaction at the end to summarize the entire interaction.
