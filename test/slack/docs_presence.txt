					User Presence
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					A user can have one of two possible presence values,
				Element:code
					active
					or
				Element:code
					away
					. A user is active if they have at least one client connected to Slack, and they are not marked as "away". There are two ways a user can be marked as away: automatic and manual.

								Automatic Away
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The Slack message servers will automatically detect activity based on messages sent from a client. If they detect no messages in 30 minutes, the user is marked as automatically away.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								However, it's possible to actively use a Slack client without causing any messages to be sent; in these situations the client can indicate activity has occurred by calling the API. Every Slack API method accepts an additional
							Element:code
								set_active
								argument. This can be used to indicate activity has occurred while performing the requested action.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If the user's activity generates no API calls then the client can periodically call
							Element:a
								users.setActive
								to let the Slack servers know about that activity.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2

								These auto-away rules do not apply to
							Element:a
								Bot Users
								.

								Manual Away
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								An application can call
							Element:a
								users.setPresence
								to manually mark a user as
							Element:code
								away
								or
							Element:code
								active
								. A manual status set using this method will persist between connections.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A manual
							Element:code
								away
								status set using this method overrides the automatic presence determined by the message server. A manual
							Element:code
								active
								presence set using this method indicates that the automatic status should be used instead.

								When using the

								the initial call to

						Node:

								When using our

								Bot users

						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When marked

								, bots will have a grey dot next to their name. Many users interpret this demarcation to mean your bot is not currently available.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								And when they are
							Element:code
								active
								, bots will have a green dot there. Users have been known to consider your green dot a badge of conversational readiness.
						Node:

								It's either/or.
							Element:code

								or

								. Grey or green.

								Please don't use presence to telegraph Morse code or teach your bot to speak the binary language of moisture vaporators. Use
							Element:a
