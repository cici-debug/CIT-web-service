											In order to be notified about new fulfillments you should subscribe your application to the
										Element:code
											fulfillments/create
											webhook. This webhook fires every time an order is marked "fulfilled", and the data is sent to a URL that you registered and stored in JSON format. You can read more about webhooks
										Element:a
											here
											. After receiving and processing the webhook your service should make a
										Element:a
											request
											to "complete" the fulfillment. You can also update the fulfillment via the API with other information like tracking_numbers rather than waiting for Shopify to ask for them.
