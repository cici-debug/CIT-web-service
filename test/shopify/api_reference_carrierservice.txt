														Access to the Carrier Services API requires the store be on the Advanced Shopify Plan or higher. The term "carrier" is often used interchangeably with "shipping".
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Using the Carrier Services API, you can register a new carrier service and provide endpoints to Shopify with a list of applicable shipping rates. With the Carrier Services API you can even use the cart data to adjust shipping rates and offer shipping discounts based on what is in the customer's cart.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														When registering a new carrier service, your will need to provide a POST endpoint rooted in the
													Element:code
														where Shopify can retrieve applicable
													Element:a
														callback_url
													Element:strong
														shipping rates
														. Your
													Element:code
														should be a public endpoint that expects these requests from Shopify.
													Element:a
														callback_url
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Shopify provides server-side caching to reduce the number of external requests. Any shipping rate estimate request that identically matches the following fields will be retrieved from Shopify's cache of the initial response:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:ul
													Element:li
														variant ids
													Element:li
														variant quantities
													Element:li
														carrier service id
													Element:li
														origin address
													Element:li
														destination address
													Element:li
														item weights & signatures
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														If any of these fields differ, or if the cache has expired since the original request, new shipping rates will be requested from the external provider.
