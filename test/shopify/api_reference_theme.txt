					A shop can have multiple themes which take the role of either "published" or "unpublished". Each shop can have 20 themes total, including one main theme, and a max of 19 unpublished themes. The published theme is the one customers see when visiting the shop in a desktop browser. Unpublished themes are themes that customers cannot currently see. When you publish a theme, the previously published theme will become unpublished.
