					ScriptTag
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The
				Element:strong
					ScriptTag
					resource represents remote javascripts which are loaded into the pages of a shop's storefront and in the order status page of checkout. This makes it easy to add functionality to those pages without touching any theme templates.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					A script tag has the following attributes:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
				Element:strong
					src
					: The URL of the remote script.
				Element:li
				Element:strong
					event
					: The DOM event which triggers the loading of the script. Currently, "onload" is the only supported event.
				Element:li
				Element:strong
					display_scope
					: Tell Shopify where to include the script; "online_store", "order_status" or "all". Default to "all".
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					ScriptTags are scoped to the app that created them. When an app is uninstalled from a shop, all of the script tags which it created are automatically removed along with it.
