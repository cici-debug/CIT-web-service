			Node:

				Element:p
					Request to charge a shop a one-time fee by issuing this call with the
				Element:code
					name
					the charge should appear under (on the shop ownerâ€™s invoice), the
				Element:code
					price
					your application is charging, and a
				Element:code
					return_url
					to where Shopify will redirect the shop owner to after they have accepted or declined the charge.
			Node:

				Element:p
					Setting the
				Element:code
					test
					flag to true will set the ApplicationCharge to not actually charge the credit card it otherwise would.
			Node:

					After this request returns, an ApplicationCharge has been created, but is held in a pending state until the shop owner has accepted or declined it.
			Node:

				Element:p
					Proceed by redirecting the shop owner to the

					confirmation_url
					set in the response where they may accept or decline the charge.
			Node:

				Element:p
					After the charge has been accepted or declined, Shopify redirects the shop owner to the
				Element:code
					return_url
					set in the request. At this point the shop is either in an
				Element:code
					accepted
					or
				Element:code
					declined
					state. Once the charge has been
				Element:code
					accepted
					, the merchant will receive the charge on their invoice. In order to actually receive payment for this charge it must be
				Element:a
					activated
					by your application.
