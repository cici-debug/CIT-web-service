					Shop owners can specify which

					or countries they will ship to and these countries are made available through the API using the country resource. Shop owners can do this by navigating to the "Preferences" tab under "Regions & Taxes." If any of those countries have states or provinces, those states or provinces are also registered as shipping destinations, each of which can have its own state or provincial sales tax.
