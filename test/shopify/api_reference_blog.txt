					Shopify blogs are like most other blogs: a content management system for articles posted in reverse chronological order. Articles can be posted under one or more user-defined categories and tagged with one or more user-defined tags, with an option to allow readers to post comments to articles. An Atom feed is automatically generated for each blog, allowing for syndication. The search functionality built into every shop also searches the text in blog articles.

					Blogs are meant to be used as a type of magazine or newsletter for the shop, with content that changes over time. If your shop needs a static page (such as an "About Us" page), we recommend that you use a Page instead.
