					Redirect
					A redirect causes a visitor on a specific path on the shop's site to be automatically sent to a target (different location). The target can be a new location on the shop's site, or a full URL, even one on a completely different domain. Redirect paths are unique; a shop cannot have more than one redirect with the same path.

The "target" attribute is the URL which the visitor is redirected to when they try to access the associated path.
