					RecurringApplicationCharge
					Request to charge a shop a recurring fee (every 30 days) by issuing this call with the
			Node:

				Element:tt
					name
					the charge should appear under (on the shop owner’s invoice), the
			Node:
			(type) c

				Element:tt
					price
					your application is charging, and a
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:tt
					return_url
					to where Shopify will redirect the shop owner to after they have accepted or declined the charge.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Setting the
				Element:tt
					test
					flag to true will set the RecurringApplicationCharge to not actually charge the credit card it otherwise would.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					After this request returns, an RecurringApplicationCharge has been created, but is held in a pending state until the shop owner has accepted or declined it.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Proceed by redirecting the shop owner to the
				Element:tt
					confirmation_url
					set in the response where they may accept or decline the charge.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					After the charge has been accepted or declined, Shopify redirects the shop owner to the
				Element:tt
					return_url
					set in the request. At this point the shop is either in an
				Element:tt
					accepted
					or
				Element:tt
					declined
					state. In order to actually receive payment for this charge it must be
				Element:a
					activated
					by your application.

											Each shop may have only one recurring charge per application.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When a new RecurringApplicationCharge is activated for a shop that already has a recurring charge for that application, the existing recurring charge will be cancelled and replaced by the new charge. The new recurring charge will then activate.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This means that upgrading and downgrading a user’s recurring charge or plan is straightforward; just change their plan, have them accept, and Shopify takes care of the rest.
