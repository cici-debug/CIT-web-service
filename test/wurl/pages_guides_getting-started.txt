					This guide is a great way to get started with the Wurl API. It is designed to get you to your first authenticated response quickly so you can start developing your application.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					If you already have a developed an application and want in-depth information about request or response formats, you probably want to check out the
				Element:a
					Reference Guide
					.
			Node:

			(layer)1
				Element:p
					To start using the Wurl API, follow these steps:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:h2
								Register as a Developer
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Please email
							Element:a
								support
								to request a developer account.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:h2
								Create an Application
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Each developer using the Wurl API associates his or her own application with a registered Wurl Application.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once you have confirmed your developer account, create your Wurl Application by visiting
							Element:a
								api.wurl.com
								and sign-in with your Wurl Developer credentials. Choose "New Application".
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you create your Wurl Application, you assign it an "Application Name" of your choosing and specify an "oAuth Callback URL". To integrate with the Wurl API via oAuth see our
							Element:a
								Authentication Guide
								. For test purposes, you can use the following url:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:h2
								Create an Access Token
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once your application has been created, click the link labeled
							Element:strong
								Create Access Token
								, and you will be directed to
							Element:strong
								your Authorized Applications
								page. Here you will see your newly created Wurl Application and your Access Token. This access token is tied to your login and application. It should be used only for development purposes and not shared amongst all your users.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								An Access Token is required for all API requests made by your Application. API requests without an access token will receive a
							Element:a
								401 - Unauthorized
								response code.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In your code, you can specify your access token via the
							Element:code
								Authorization
								header:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you are unable to set request headers, you can also provide an
							Element:code
								access_token
								query parameter:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								https://api.wurl.com/api?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The Wurl API follows the tenets of a
							Element:a
								Hypermedia
								API. Therefore, you should avoid constructing URLs. We recommend that you specify the
							Element:code
								Authorization
								request header so that you can use the URLs the API provides without having to constantly append the
							Element:code
								access_token
								query parameter.

							Element:h2
								Make your first API Request
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You’re now ready to make your first API request. You can make an api request with
							Element:strong
								curl
								(replace
							Element:em
								YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
								with your Access Token):
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								$ curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' https://api.wurl.com/api { "links": [ { "rel": [ "self" ], "href": "https://api.wurl.com/api" }, { "rel": [ "bundles" ], "href": "https://api.wurl.com/api/bundles" }, .....
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Or you can make the request via a browser by passing the
							Element:code
								access token
								query parameter:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								https://api.wurl.com/api?format=json&access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								That's it!
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To learn about the Wurl API and the content in the Wurl Index, we recommend you create a simple "Browse" app. See the
							Element:a
								Packages
								guide for tips.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A tool like
							Element:a
								jshon
								allows you to pretty print and query json output from curl as shown above.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A browser extension like
							Element:a
								JSONView
								or
							Element:a
								Postman
								makes working with JSON responses much easier on the eyes.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
