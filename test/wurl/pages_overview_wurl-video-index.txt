We've developed a ranking algorithm, ChannelsRank, that is uniquely effective at surfacing high quality video from professional publishers in any language. Through this needle-in-a-haystack process, our servers are constantly searching among the +1 billion video series on the web with the goal of identifying the +100,000 best ones to add to our index.

					Wurl Index contains detailed metadata from the web's best video “Series”. In our terminology, a series is a collection of videos, published over time with some regularity usually focused around a single topic. Examples of a Series include: a Channel on YouTube, a music artist’s video collection on Vevo, a collection of MLB clips on SI.com, full episodes of a French reality show, etc.
