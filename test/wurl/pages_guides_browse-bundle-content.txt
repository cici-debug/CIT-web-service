			Node:

				Element:p
					Each application using the Wurl API has access to curated selections of video Series named "Bundles". Developers often use Bundles to create a guide that allows users to browse by category (Bundle). Our API makes it easy to create an app to:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ol
				Element:li
					Browse Bundles
				Element:li
					Drill down to browse the Series in each Bundle
				Element:li
					Drill down further to review & play the video Episodes in each Series.
			Node:

				Element:p
					The steps below provide a sample of how to make API requests to build a simple guide in your application.
			Node:

			(layer)1
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:h2
								Prerequisites
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To run through the following steps, you will need to have created an
							Element:em
								application
								and have an
							Element:em
								access token
								. The
							Element:a
								Getting Started Guide
								provides steps on how to do that.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:h2
								Get the Bundles
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The first step is to request the root url of the API.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								https://api.wurl.com/api?format=json&access_token=YOUR_TOKEN
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:i
								Setting the
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:a
								Authorization
								header in your http client relieves you of the need to constantly construct URLs to add the access token.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The response will contain a
							Element:em
								links
								array:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ ... "links": [ { "rel": [ "urn:x-resource:name:bundles" ], "href": "https://api.wurl.com/api/bundles" } ... ] }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Your app should parse the JSON and iterate the
							Element:em
								links
								collection looking for the rel named
							Element:em
								bundles
								("urn:x-resource:name:bundles").
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once you have found the
							Element:em
								bundles
								link, request the URL specified in the
							Element:em
								href
								attribute of the link.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								https://api.wurl.com/api/bundles?format=json&access_token=YOUR_TOKEN
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The response will contain an
							Element:em
								entities
								array that lists all the bundles you have available. The abbreviated response below shows an example
							Element:em
								bundle
								entity:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "rel": [ "urn:x-resource:schema:https://api.wurl.com/schemas/bundles.json" ], "class": [ "bundles", "collection", "wurl-bundles" ], "entities": [ { "rel": [ "item", "urn:x-resource:name:bundle", "urn:x-resource:schema:https://api.wurl.com/schemas/bundle.json" ], "class": [ "bundle", "wurl-bundle" ], "properties": { "id": 56, "title": "Featured Videos", "slug": "Featured_US", "description": "Featured series for US market", "primaryLanguage": "en", "category": "Mix", "totalItems": 15 }, "entities": [ { "rel": [ "top-series", "urn:x-resource:schema:https://api.wurl.com/schemas/series.json" ], "class": [ "series", "wurl-series" ], "properties": {...} "entities": [...] "actions": [...] "links": [...] }, { "rel": [ "urn:x-resource:name:items", "bundle-items" ], "href": "https://api.wurl.com/api/bundles/56/items", "class": [ "link", "collection", "bundle-items", "wurl-bundle-items" ] } ], "links": [ { "rel": [ "self" ], "href": "https://api.wurl.com/api/bundles/56" }, { "rel": [ "up" ], "href": "https://api.wurl.com/api/bundles" } ] }, ], "links": [ { "rel": [ "self" ], "href": "https://api.wurl.com/api/bundles" }, { "rel": [ "up" ], "href": "https://api.wurl.com/api" } ] }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								As you iterate the
							Element:em
								entities
								collection of the
							Element:em
								bundles
								response, you can extract the
							Element:em
								title
								property of each
							Element:em
								bundle
								and use that for displaying a summary of the categories of content in your application's interface.

								as a sample of what the bundle contains. The

								("urn:x-resource:name:items").
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Since the
