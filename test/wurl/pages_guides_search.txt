					Query Syntax
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					When searching, all the terms in your query are individual terms that are ANDed together. To search for a specific multi-word query (eg: star wars) you can enclose search terms in double quotes.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
				Element:code
					q="star wars"
					matches the exact term "star wars"
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					You can also use the boolean operators + (AND), | (OR), and - (NOT). If you separate search terms with + or a space, all of the search terms are ANDed together. You can use the | (OR) operator to separate terms when you want either the preceding term(s) or the following term(s). To exclude a particular term, prefix the term with the - (NOT) operator. The NOT operator only applies to individual terms.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					For example:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
				Element:code
					q=star+wars
					matches star and wars.
				Element:li
				Element:code
					q=star|wars
					matches either star or wars.
				Element:li
				Element:code
					q=star|wars-trek
					matches either star or wars but does not contain trek.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					You can use the * (asterisk) wildcard operator to perform some limited wildcard matching. The * operator only applies to individual terms. When you append the * operator to a string, the string is treated as a prefix.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
				Element:code
					q=star*
					matches any words that start with 'star' (star, start, etc...)
