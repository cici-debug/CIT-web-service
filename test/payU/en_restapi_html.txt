											There are two stages to processing a payment in an e-shop via PayU:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ol
										Element:li
											A buyer places an order on an e-shop webpage.
										Element:li
											PayU confirms that the payment has been settled correctly.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:h4
											Stage 1: buyer places an order.
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:p
											The process is shown below:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ol
										Element:li
											The buyer clicks on a button that is linked to the PayU payment service.
										Element:li
											The PayU system presents an order summary webpage, where the buyer confirms the payment, then redirects the buyer to a bank website.
										Element:li
											The buyer accepts the payment on the bank website. The buyer is redirected back to the PayU system.
										Element:li
											The merchant system confirms the transaction was successful and thanks the buyer.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:h4
											Stage 2: payment settlement (optional).
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ol
										Element:li
											The PayU system notifies the merchant system that the payment order status has changed as per its lifecycle.
										Element:li

						Node:

								To set the language of the page displayed after redirection, either use the lang parameter (see the section

								This option is intended for buyers unable to make Czech or Polish online bank transfers.
						Node:

							Element:pre
								{ "payMethods": { "payMethod": { "type":"PBL", "value":"c" } } }
						Node:

								After the order is created with the above, the
							Element:code
								redirectUri
								will contain link to the card payment form.
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can specify the language of the form using any of the following methods:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
								Method 1: based on the language setting of the buyer's browser. If the browser language is not supported, the default language (English) is displayed.
							Element:li
								Method 2: add the

								lang
								parameter to
							Element:code
								redirectUri
								, as described in the section

								Creating a new order via API
								.
							Element:li
								Method 3: add the

								3 Notifications
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:blockquote
								Each payment in the PayU system has a lifecycle, which is comprised of stages related to key events such as acceptance, settlement, and cancellation. PayU provides you with a mechanism that notifies your system of all changes to the payment status.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:h4
														Overview
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														To enable notifications for a specific payment, specify the
													Element:code
														notifyUrl
														parameter in the payment form. Each payment can receive a different URL to which notifications will be sent.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Every notification is sent asynchronously. After your system receives a notification with the status completed, instruct it to ignore any further notifications.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														After sending a notification, the PayU system requires a 200 HTTP status code in response. If it receives a different status code, it will resend the notification.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														To ensure trusted communication between PayU and your shop, you must verify the signature value available in the OpenPayu-Signature header each time your system receives any notification from a PayU server. Refer to the
													Element:a
														Verification of notifications signature
														for more information.

														Payment lifecycle
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														You can configure a separate auto-receive / automatic collection parameter for each payment method via the Management Panel.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														By default, auto-receive is enabled. The basic payment sequence is as follows:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:ol
													Element:li
														Each successfully authorized payment for an order is captured.
													Element:li
														The buyer is charged with the order amount.
													Element:li
														The shop balance is increased by the order amount.
													Element:li
														PayU calculates its commission to the order.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														If the auto-receive is turned off, you should capture each order using a PUT method (
													Element:a
														Order capture
														) or cancele using DELETE method (
													Element:a
														Cancellation
														).
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														If no such action is taken the order is auto-canceled. Automatic cancellation occurs after a number of days indicated for the
													Element:a
														payment method
														.

													Element:tr
													Element:td
														REJECTED
													Element:td
														Payment has been rejected, but the buyer was charged (the money was transferred from the buyer to PayU). The merchant can either complete the order and receive the money or cancel it to return the money to the buyer.

							Element:li
								Check the type of a hashing function used to generate the signature (this is usually md5)
							Element:li
								Combine the body of the incoming notification with the value of second_key:
							Element:pre
								string concatenated = JSONnotification + second_key;
							Element:li
								Select an expected signature value by applying the hashing function (e.g. md5) in the received chain of characters:
							Element:pre
								string expected_signature = md5(concatenated)
							Element:li
								Compare the strings: expected_signature and incoming_signature:
