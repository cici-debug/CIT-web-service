											When a project is created on MODE, developer must specify how user accounts should be handled. By default, a project uses the built-in user account system provided by MODE. But a project can also implement its own separate account system for its users. So based on the type of the project, this API call does one of the following.

														Register a new user. The request body must be a valid user object containing the
													Element:code
														projectId
														,
													Element:code
														phoneNumber
														and
													Element:code
														name
														fields. The phone number must not be in use by a current user of the project. An SMS text containing a verification code will be sent to the user to confirm the registration.

													Element:code
														Authorization
														header that contains a
													Element:strong
														Project API Key
														with the permission to handle BYOU. The returned user object contains a unique user ID. The caller should store this user ID for future MODE API calls.
