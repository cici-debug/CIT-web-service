								Uploading Images
							Element:a
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Image uploads can be performed using a POST request with the
							Element:code
								Content-Type: multipart/form-data
								header, following
							Element:a
								RFC1867
								. This is identical to using
							Element:em
								curl -F
								, except that that request needs to be signed using OAuth.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Your OAuth toolkit must support multipart form uploads as described above. Here is example code for PHP using the
							Element:a
								PECL OAuth 1.1
								extension (PECL OAuth 1.0 will not work):
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								// You must define the constants OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY and OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET // You must also assign values to the variables $access_token, $access_token_secret, // $listing_id and $filename, and $mimetype. // Your image file is assumed to be in the same directory as this code. $oauth = new OAuth(OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY, OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET); $oauth->enableDebug(); $oauth->setToken($access_token, $access_token_secret); try { $source_file = dirname(realpath(__FILE__)) ."/$filename"; $url = "https://openapi.etsy.com/v2/listings/".$listing_id."/images"; $params = array('@image' => '@'.$source_file.';type='.$mimetype); $oauth->fetch($url, $params, OAUTH_HTTP_METHOD_POST); $json = $oauth->getLastResponse(); print_r(json_decode($json, true)); } catch (OAuthException $e) { // You may want to recover gracefully here... print $oauth->getLastResponse()."\n"; print_r($oauth->debugInfo); die($e->getMessage()); }
