								Etsy is a marketplace, and the Etsy API makes it easy to display listings either for an individual store, or across the Etsy marketplace as a whole. In addition, the Etsy API gives you access to an Etsy member's favorite listings, sellers, and recommended listings from our recommendation engine. Finally, using the Etsy API, you can add listings to a member's cart, and direct him or her back to Etsy.com for checkout.

								Items for sale on Etsy are called listings. Each Etsy listing has a number of associated resources, which taken as a whole, describe the entire item for sale:

							Element:p
							Element:img

							Element:ul
							Element:li

								is the main resource and contains the item description and quantity currently available.
							Element:a
								Listing
							Element:li
								Each listing is indirectly associated with one
							Element:code
								(note that the true association is made between users and listings.) Use
							Element:a
								Shop
							Element:code
								to query the currently available listings for a shop.
							Element:a
								findAllShopListingsActive
							Element:li
								Each shop can optionally have one or more
							Element:code
								Use
							Element:a
								ShopSections
							Element:code
								to find all the sections for a given shop.
							Element:a
								findAllShopSections
							Element:li
								Each listing can have up to five images, uploaded by the seller. Use either the
							Element:code
								or
							Element:a
								MainImage
							Element:code
								associations of Listing to retrieve these images. You can also use the dedicated
							Element:a
								Images
							Element:code
								method.
							Element:a
								findAllListingImages
							Element:li
								Each listing will have one or more
							Element:code
								describing the payment methods accepted by the seller.
							Element:a
								ListingPayments
							Element:li
							Element:code
								records describe the locations that the seller will ship to, and the cost. Each shipping info record is associated with two
							Element:a
								ShippingInfo
							Element:code
								records describing the country of origin, and the destination country for the shipping record.
							Element:a
								Country
							Element:li
								Country records may be associated with a
							Element:code
								. The region is used to populate a number of shipping info records at the time that the listing is created. However, the data is completely denormalized, meaning that all of the relevant shipping information exists in the shipping info records. You may choose to collapse on the region record, or ignore it completely.

								To search listings across all of Etsy, use

								is a linking resource that connects an Etsy member to a listing they're favorited. This resource is typically used with the
							Element:a
								FavoriteListing
							Element:code
								association to pull the actual listing being favorited.
							Element:a
								Listing
							Element:li
							Element:code
								is a linking resource that connects and Etsy member to another member whose shop they've favorited. (Note that although the Etsy.com site referrs to "favorite shops," the link is actually made between users.) Use the
							Element:a
								FavoriteUser
							Element:code
								association to pull the user being favorited.
							Element:a

						Node:

								The Etsy API allows you to query the favorites for a given member, as well as all the members who's marked a listing or another member as a favorite:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								For listings, use
							Element:code
								to pull favorite listings for an Etsy member, and
							Element:a
								findAllUserFavoriteListings
							Element:code
								to find all members who've marked a listing as a favorite.
							Element:a
								findAllListingFavoredBy
							Element:li
								For users, user
							Element:code
								to pull favorite users for an Etsy member, and
							Element:a
								findAllUserFavoriteUsers
							Element:code
								to find all member's who's marked a user as a favorite.
							Element:a
								findAllUserFavoredBy
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								Note that FavoriteUser is doubly-linked to user: the

								The Etsy API gives apps access to Etsy's recommendation engine. Because recommendations are tailored to a specific Etsy member, this requires OAuth access. Use
							Element:code
								to access a member's recommendations.
							Element:a
								getRecommendedListings
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once you've shown an Etsy member his or her recommendations, register the views with
							Element:code
								. This prevents the same listings from coming up again in recommendations (which would be repetitive.) You might also want to give the user the option of rejecting the recommendations with
							Element:a
								registerRecommendedListingViews
							Element:code
								. Not only does this prevent the listings from coming up again, it improves the quality of new recommendations.
							Element:a
								registerRecommendedListingRejects
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Recommended listings are recalculated every 24 hours, so changes in recommendations will not show up immediately. Also, be aware that it's possible to exhaust a member's recommended listings, in which case you'll need to wait another 24 hours for new recommendations to become available.

								Using the Etsy API, apps can add listings to an Etsy member's shopping cart. Although the Etsy.com site exposes the member's cart as a single resource, it's actually a number of carts, with listings sorted by the shop selling them. (This is because Etsy transactions happen directly between the buyer and the seller, so payment must be made individually to each seller at a time.)
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
							Element:code
								is the main resource; an Etsy member will have zero or more carts, one for each seller. Cart resources are automatically managed; it's not necessary for apps to create the cart before listings can be added to it. Simply posting the listing ID to the member's cart with
							Element:a
								Cart
							Element:code
								will create the cart as necessary. When a cart is emptied completely using
							Element:a
								addToCart
							Element:code
								, it will be automatically destroyed. Apps can also empty a full cart in one request using
							Element:a
								removeCartListing
							Element:code
								.
							Element:a
								deleteCart
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:code
								is a linking resource that holds the ID of the listing in the cart and the quantity added. The
							Element:a
								CartListing
							Element:code
								field of the cart resource will contain an array of cart listings. To retrieve the actual Listings in the member's cart, use the association
							Element:a
								listings
							Element:code
								.

								In addition, buyers may apply a coupon code to the cart using
