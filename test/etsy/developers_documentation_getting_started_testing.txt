								Developers test their Etsy API applications on production. However, some testing activity looks very similar to fraud. Our testing policies are designed to help you test your app while protecting our marketplace from abusive behavior.

								If you create test listings, use low prices (< $1) and deactivate them as soon as you have finished testing.
							Element:li
								Create listings in draft state when possible. This removes the need to deactivate them later and also helps you avoid listing fees.
							Element:li
								Set your shop to only accept payment type, "Other". To do this, visit Your Shop > Finances > Accepted Payments and ensure that "Other" is the only acccepted payment type. If you have a scenario that you believe requires a different payment type, please email a description of the use case to
							Element:a
								developer@etsy.com
								.
							Element:li
								Enable
							Element:a
								Developer Mode
								for your shop. This will further reduce the chance that a buyer will accidentally find and buy your test listings. Note that you will still be charged for any test listings you create in production, and you are resposible for paying this bill.
							Element:li
								If you accidentally sell something, you must

								cancel the transaction
								. Contact Etsy Support if you have any trouble doing so. Failure to fulfill or cancel the order will result in suspension of your account.
