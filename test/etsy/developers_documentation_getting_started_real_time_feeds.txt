					The Etsy API now has infrastructure to support real-time updates of our data. Our first available feed is the real-time listings feed and we also now have per shop real-time listings feeds.
				Element:strong
					This resource is not generally available. If you would like access, please write to

											To access our API, you will need an

											api_key
											. An
										Element:code
											api_key
											is a parameter you will need to include in every request to our API. Note the key for real-time feeds is separate from the key used for the rest of the api, and each developer's key will be unique and have its own rate limits and daily call quotas.

														Unlike our regular API methods, these results are not cached and regular polling will return a complete list of
													Element:a
														Listings
														. You can control the number of listings returned by using a
													Element:code
														time_limit
														(default of 10 seconds) and
													Element:code
														time_offset
														parameter (no default and required, units are epoch seconds). In addition,
													Element:code
														limit
														(default 25, max 100) and
													Element:code
														offset
														(default 0) parameters can be used in conjunction with the
													Element:code
														time_limit
														and
													Element:code
														time_offset
														parameters. We currently have around ~250 new listings a minute on average, though this is subject to time of day, year, and our growth, so you'll want to retrieve several times a minute to make sure you don't miss any new listings.

														Listings in this feed mean there has been some sort of change to it. This may mean that the Listing underwent one of several actions: it may have been newly created, renewed, activated (left
													Element:code
														edit
														state), deactivated (in
													Element:code
														edit
														state), deleted, the user is on vacation, or removed for unspecified reasons. Only Listings with a state of
													Element:code
														active
														are available for sale.
												Node:

														The possible states for Listings in the feed are:
													Element:code

														,
													Element:code

														,
													Element:code
														removed
														,
													Element:code
														edit
														,
													Element:code
														vacation
														,
													Element:code
														private
														,
													Element:code
														unavailable
														. The items available for purchase have only one state:
													Element:code
														active
														. Any other state indicates that the item cannot currently be purchased, and you can remove it from display from your site. You may continue to link to Listing pages that are
													Element:code
														sold_out
														or in
													Element:code
														vacation
														state, but Listings in these states are not purchasable.

														As when parsing methods that return Listings in our regular api, you'll need to be careful that Listings in various states may expose fewer fields than items in the
													Element:code
														active
														state. For items in the
													Element:code
														vacation
														or
													Element:code
														sold_out
														state, all fields will be exposed, with the exception that
													Element:code
														sold_out
														listings will not display
													Element:code
														price
														. For all other states, the only guaranteed fields will be
													Element:code
														listing_id
														and

											We also provide the option to retrieve listings in a valid, standards-compliant Atom format. It is essentially a mapping of our

											The mapping is as follows. The left column is an XPath of an element in the Atom feed, and the right column is a Resource field (described in our API documentation). X means the element does not correspond to a standard resource field and a description follows.
