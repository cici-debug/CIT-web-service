					If your app doesn't need write access for users outside of yourself, and you don't need to be listed in the App Gallery, you're done! You can continue to use the production API with your API key indefinitely. This is an acceptable choice for apps that, for instance, display your Etsy listings on your blog.
				Element:li
					If you need write access for the public or want to be listed in the App Gallery, click the "Get Full Access" link next to your app in
				Element:a
					Apps You Made
					. We'll take a look to make sure you're abiding by our
				Element:a
					Terms Of Use
					and check that your app meets the criteria listed below. If you requested it, your app will also be listed in the app gallery if your application is approved.

					A quick note about App Gallery listings: the App Gallery is intended as a place for developers to showcase apps that are of broad interest to the Etsy community. Apps that only serve one particular shop or Etsy member (such as displaying your Etsy listings on your personal website or blog) are
				Element:em
					not
					considered appropriate for inclusion in the App Gallery. In these cases,
				Element:a
					Provisional Access
					is generally sufficient.
