								When in the context of a
							Element:code
								, special attention should be paid to the
							Element:a
								CartListing
							Element:code
								is_valid
								property. This will be
							Element:code
								false
								in the event that the variation has been changed or removed since the listing was added to the cart. Additionally, the
							Element:code
								purchase_state
								property of the parent
							Element:code
								will have a value of
							Element:a
								CartListing
							Element:code
								edited
								to signal this state. In this case the listing needs to be removed and re-added to the cart with a valid variation.
