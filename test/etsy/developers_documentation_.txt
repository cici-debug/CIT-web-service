					Etsy is the world's most vibrant handmade marketplace. The Etsy API lets developers tap into the Etsy community, building their own Etsy-powered applications for the web, desktop and mobile devices. We hope the API will help connect buyers with sellers, promote the handmade lifestyle, and support the craftspeople who sell on Etsy.
