							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Languages in the API are expressed as IETF language codes. (e.g.
							Element:code
								en
								for English or
							Element:code
								fr
								for French)
							Element:li
								A language is expressed in each REST request as the "language" parameter like this:
							Element:code
								/listings/12345?language=fr
							Element:li
								The
							Element:em
								supported
								languages are currently: (
							Element:code
								de, en, es, fr, it, ja, nl, pt, ru
								). We are always adding to this list.
							Element:li
								"Machine languages" designate automated translations and have
							Element:code
								MACHINE_
								prepended to their codes. (e.g.
							Element:code
								MACHINE_en
								for generated English text or
							Element:code
								MACHINE_fr
								for generated French text)
							Element:li
								If no parameter is given, English (
							Element:code
								en
								) is assumed.

							Element:ul
							Element:li
								For resources like a Category's name or a Country's name the content returned by the API will always be in the language you request, so long as that language is a
							Element:em
								supported
								language (
							Element:code
								de, en, es, fr, it, ja, nl, pt, ru
								).
							Element:li
								For user-generated content like Shops or Listings, the content may not be
							Element:em
								available
								in all languages.
							Element:li
								The languages
							Element:em
								available
								for a piece of user-generated content (a Shop or a Listing) is controlled by which Translations the owner of that content has provided.
							Element:li
								If you request a language which is unavailable for a specific piece of user-generated content, content in the
							Element:em
								available
								languages will "bleed through" so that required fields (like a Listing's title field) will never be blank.

											Bleedthrough Rules
										Element:a
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Translations data for user-generated content must be in a language that is both supported by Etsy and available from the user who created that content. The following rules apply for reading any user-generated content's translatable fields:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ol
										Element:li
											Return the content in the language the user asked for.
										Element:li
											If that content is not available, return machine language content based on the language the user asked for. For example, if the user requested french, return machine french content.
										Element:li
											If that content is not available, return English content.
										Element:li
											If English is also not available, return the content in the "Primary Language" of the seller account who created the content. (All shops have a Primary Language setting, and it doesn't have to be English.)

											For this example pretend a Listing has been translated by the Seller into English, French and German. Notice that requesting Chinese returns the same data as requesting English, since Chinese is not available or supported at all.

								Translations as Resources

						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								ShopTranslations and ListingTranslations are new types of resources in the API. This provides a more detailed perspective on the Translations data. These resources can be accessed individually like so:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:table
							Element:tr
							Element:th
								Request
							Element:th
								Response
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								/listings/12345/translations/en
							Element:td
							Element:code
								{ "title": Example Listing Title, "language": en }
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								/listings/12345/translations/de
							Element:td
							Element:code
								{ "title": Beispiel Titel der Auflistung, "language": de }
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								/listings/12345/translations/fr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								{ "title": Titre Annonce Exemple, "language": fr }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The last parameter serves as the language parameter. The critical difference with the data returned by these resources is that they
							Element:em
								do not use
								the idea of bleedthrough. If you ask for data in a language the Seller has not provided, the result will be blank.
