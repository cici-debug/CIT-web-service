								A Guest represents an anonymous user that is using the Etsy API that has not yet authenticated, but may wish to store some information before authenticating (currently, guest carts). Guests are identified via a random 13-digit hash, which is unique to every Application.
							Element:strong
								Important: This guest ID is associated directly to your Application, and will not be accessible through other API keys.
								Although Guests do not require an authenticated user, they do require your app to have production access in order to be interacted with.
