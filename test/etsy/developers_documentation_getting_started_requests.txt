								How to Make A Request And Process The Response
							Element:a
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Here's a step-by-step example of how to make a request to the Etsy API. This example uses the public endpoint, so no OAuth authentication is required. For an example using OAuth, see the next section.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								We'll make a request to get details for the user that runs the official Etsy store, "EtsyStore" using the
							Element:code
								method. You can also substitute your own user name for "EtsyStore". If you consult the documentation for that method, you'll see the following:
							Element:a
								getUser
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:table
							Element:tbody
							Element:tr
							Element:th
								Method Name
							Element:td
							Element:code
								getUser
							Element:tr
							Element:th
								Synopsis
							Element:td
								Retrieves a User by id.
							Element:tr
							Element:th
								HTTP Method
							Element:td
							Element:code
								GET
							Element:tr
							Element:th
								URI
							Element:td
							Element:code
								/users/:user_id
							Element:tr
							Element:th
								Parameters
							Element:td
							Element:table
							Element:tbody
							Element:tr
							Element:th
								Name
							Element:th
								Required
							Element:th
								Default
							Element:th
								Type
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								user_id
							Element:td
							Element:code
								Y
							Element:td
							Element:code
							Element:td
							Element:code
								array(user_id_or_name)
							Element:tr
							Element:th
								Return Type
							Element:td
							Element:code
								User
							Element:tr
							Element:th
								Requires OAuth
							Element:td
							Element:code

								Every Etsy API request begins with the base URL:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								https://openapi.etsy.com/v2
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								and ends with the URI for the command. The part of the URI that reads
							Element:code
								:user_id
								is an embedded parameterâ€”you'll need to substitute either the user name "etsystore" or the ID of the user you're trying to access.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Finally, you'll add a question mark (
							Element:code
								?
								) plus any optional parameters you'd like to send, and of course, your API key. The final request looks like this:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								https://openapi.etsy.com/v2/users/etsystore?api_key=
							Element:em
								your_api_key
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can test this right in your browser. You should see a long string of JSON data language. Note that the object returned is of resource type
							Element:code
								User
								. See
							Element:code
								in the API Reference for more details.
							Element:a

											Sample Request from PHP
										Element:a
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Here is an example of a call in a PHP script. You can use any language that supports HTTP requests (JavaScript, Ruby, Perl...) which is just about every language in use on the web.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											// Make sure you define API_KEY to be your unique, registered key $url = "https://openapi.etsy.com/v2/users/etsystore?api_key=" . API_KEY; $ch = curl_init($url); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true); $response_body = curl_exec($ch); $status = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE); if (intval($status) != 200) throw new Exception("HTTP $status\n$response_body");
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Notice that in line #6 we're using the value of $response_body as an error message. In the event of an error, the response body will contain a plaintext formatted explanation of the problem. The error will not be JSON encoded.

											Sample Response
										Element:a
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Here's the response from our request above (with added white space to make it easier to read.) The response is formatted using JSON, a simple data serialization language that can be used by just about any language on the web. (
										Element:a
											Find JSON support for your language
											.)
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											{ "count": 1, "results": [ { "user_id": 5029420, "login_name": "EtsyStore", "creation_tsz": 1166740121, "referred_by_user_id": null, "feedback_info": { "count": 2559, "score": 100 } } ], "params": { "user_id": "etsystore", }, "type": "User" }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Notice that in the response above, the user name "etsystore" that you passed in has been helpfully converted into a user ID. Since it's slightly more efficient to look up users by ID, we suggest that you use the ID for subsequent requests.

											Sample Response in PHP
										Element:a
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:p
											And here's how we'd parse and use the response in PHP:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											$response = json_decode($response_body); $user = $response->results[0]; if (!isset($user->login_name)) { throw new RuntimeException("User Resource doesn't have field login_name"); } if (!isset($user->feedback_info->score)) { throw new RuntimeException("User Resource doesn't have field feedback_info['score']"); } print "User $user->login_name has a feedback score of {$user->feedback_info->score}\n";
