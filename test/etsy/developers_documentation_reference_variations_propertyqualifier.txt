							Element:p
								A component of the larger
							Element:code
								data structure, a property qualifier is a recursive data structure describing increasing specificity of a property. For example, for a listing in the
							Element:a
								Variations_PropertySet
							Element:em
								Clothing: Pants
								category, the
							Element:em
								Size
								property is further qualified by the
							Element:em
								Recipient
								and
							Element:em
								Scale
								qualifying properties. A property qualifier describes these dependencies.
