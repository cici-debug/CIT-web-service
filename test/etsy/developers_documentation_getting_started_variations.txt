							Element:p
								As of October, 2012, Etsy listings may contain options that buyers can select from when adding to cart and checking out ("Listing Variations".) These options are simple key=>value pairs, where the key refers to a
							Element:code
								and the value refers to a
							Element:a
								Variations_Property
							Element:code
								. Sellers use Listing Variations to offer different options within the same listing (e.g., different sizes and colors.) Buyers will need to choose from the options while purchasing the item.
							Element:a
								Variations_Option
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Listing with Variations are also qualified by one or more
							Element:code
								— attributes like sizing scale (US, EU, JP, inches, centimeters, etc.) and recipient (Women, Men, Children, etc.) that help put the Variations option in context.
							Element:a
								Variations_PropertyQualifiers
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Whereas variation properties can have multiple values associated with them, qualifier properties can have only one. Also, whereas variation properties can be associated with any user-defined value, qualifiers will only accept certain values. The full list of qualifier values is too extensive to publish in this document. To find legal qualifier values, see

								When browsing a listing, buyers may specify a variation from those available in order to add to cart. The variation properties and their options are exposed on the

							Element:a

							Element:code
								(which indicates whether or not the listing has variations) and
							Element:a
								has_variations

								We do not offer sellers the ability to enter custom translations of Variations data at this time.
								This means that any custom Variation property names and custom option values entered by sellers will always be displayed in the seller's primary shop language. We are still evaluating the best way to make Variations available in all languages.
						Node:

							Element:p
								However, all standard property names and suggested option values provided by Etsy are translated into the languages that Etsy offers as site languages. Variations-related API methods respond to the standard

								NOTE:
								Buyers using the Etsy website must choose from available Variations when adding items to their Cart. This requirement is not yet enforced in the API, to protect backwards-compatibility with existing apps.

										Element:p
											A Listing can be assigned any combination of properties and values. But, certain properties are suggested conditional on the listing's category. The complete list of eligible properties is called a
										Element:code
											. A PropertySet exposes 4 pieces of data:
										Element:a
											Variations_PropertySet
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
										Element:code
											properties
											— a dictionary of properties that are available as variations
										Element:li
										Element:code
											qualifying_properties
											— a dictionary of properties that are used to add specificity to one or more variation properties
										Element:li
										Element:code
											options
											— a dictionary of available property options for any of the qualifying properties
										Element:li
										Element:code
											qualifier
											— a recursive data-structure indicating the property options available for qualifying_properties, and the nested qualifiers available for each option
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Any
										Element:code
											in the
										Element:a
											property
										Element:code
											properties
											list is currently available to the listing as potential variations. Any property in
										Element:code
											qualifying_properties
											are supported, for a finite set of options, to add specificity to a given property from the list of properties. This relationship and the options available for these properties are described in the
										Element:code
											qualifiers
											data structure.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											qualifiers
											data structure is keyed by
										Element:code
											property_id
											, which corresponds to an entry in the
										Element:code
											properties
											list to be described. From there, a
										Element:code
											will have a
										Element:a
											qualifier
										Element:code
											property_id
											, which will point to a
										Element:code
											, and a set of options available for that
										Element:a
											qualifying property
										Element:code
											. Each option can then potentially specify another set of qualifiers, keyed off of option id in the
										Element:a
											qualifying property
										Element:code
											results
											dictionary, recursing the data structure.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											NOTE:
											The qualifier
										Element:code
											recipient_id
											points to the same data point as the existing field
										Element:code
											on Listings. Setting one will overwrite the value of the other. When using Variations, it's recommended to avoid setting
										Element:a
											recipient
										Element:code
											recipient
											in favor of the
										Element:code
											recipient_id
											qualifier, using one of the values suggested by
										Element:code
											. This will ensure that the Listing's Variations data is ready for future search integration.

																	The fact that the only key in

																	results
																	and
																Element:code

																Element:code
																	property_id

																	is a list of possible values for

																	fields lists instructions to be taken when specific values for

																	to

																	(which maps to

																	Babies
																	).
																Element:li
																	The next qualifying property,
																Element:code
																	300
																	maps to
																Element:code
																	Sizing Scale
																Element:li
																	We repeat the process: display a
																Element:code
																	Sizing Scale
																	menu with values taken from
																Element:code
																	options
																	, and allow the seller to choose one. These options happen to map to "Alpha" and "Months", two common sizing systems for infant clothing.
