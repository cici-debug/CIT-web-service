								tyntec’s Global Number Portability (GNP) resolves number portability by obtaining data directly from local number portability databases and live network information from across the globe.

								GNP is available with the Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API). This interface enables quick and easy access to tyntec’s Number Information Services (NIS). The communication is established via Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) connections. The exchanged object type is JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). tyntec’s application accepts and replies with “application/json” as “Content-Type” (and “charset=utf-8”) in the HTTP header.

								Here’s a basic example showing to resolve Global Number Portability:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								curl -u username:password -X GET https://rest.tyntec.com/nis/v1/gnp?msisdn=+491622943176

								Authentication is done during the setup of the REST API connection.
						Node:

							Element:p
								tyntec will provide a username (${username}) and password (${password}) to grant access to services:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								https://${username}:${password}@rest.tyntec.com/nis/v1/
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The Base64-encoded combination "${username}:${password}" is used as an authentication token for the Basic HTTP authentication and can also be given in the HTTP header:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								Authorization: Basic ${authentication-token}
