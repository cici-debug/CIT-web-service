								Unsuccessful query
						Node:

							Element:p
								If the system cannot return a result for the query, a LocationReject with an error description in the rejectReasonString element (in form of an IA5String) is returned. For example:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								RasMessage ::= locationReject : { requestSeqNum 39, locationRejectReason rejectReasonString ‚requestDenied‘H, }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								There are five cases in which no result can be returned. The following list shows these cases, accompanied by the returned rejectReasonString:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								The request is not parseable: requestDenied
							Element:li
								The request could not be authenticated: invalidPermission
							Element:li
								The system handling the request is not able to handle the request at this time: undefinedReason
							Element:li
								The number does not exist or is not a callable MSISDN (e.g. it is a Global Title): noRouteToDestination
							Element:li
								The request could not be processed in time: undefinedReason
