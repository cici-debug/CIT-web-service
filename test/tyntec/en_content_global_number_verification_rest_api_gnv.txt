								tyntec’s Global Number Verification (GNV) minimizes message loss and unsuccessful call attempts with real-time phone number verification, providing key information on a user’s phone number, such as subscriber status and roaming data.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								GNV is available with the Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API). This interface enables quick and easy access to tyntec’s Number Information Services (NIS). The communication is established via Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) connections. The exchanged object type is JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). tyntec’s application accepts and replies with “application/json” as “Content-Type” (and “charset=utf-8”) in the HTTP header.

								Here’s a basic example showing how to resolve Global Number Verification:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								curl -u username:password -X GET https://rest.tyntec.com/nis/v1/gnv?msisdn=+491622943176

								tyntec will provide a username (${username}) and password (${password}) to grant access to services:
							Element:code
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								https://${username}:${password}@rest.tyntec.com/nis/v1/
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:span
								The Base64-encoded combination "${username}:${password}" is used as an authentication token for the Basic HTTP authentication and can also be given in the HTTP header, as the following:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								Authorization: Basic ${authentication-token}
