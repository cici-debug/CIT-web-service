								tyntec’s Global Number Portability (GNP) resolves number portability by obtaining data directly from local number portability databases and live network information from across the globe.

								Global Number Portability is available with the Synchronous SOAP API.
						Node:

								SOAP is a protocol used for exchanging messages over a computer network. The messages that are sent do not rely on the underlying transport protocol, which is in most cases HTTP (and in the specific case of the tyntec infrastructure).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The messages themselves are structured as XML documents and are defined in two parts:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								SOAP standard
							Element:br
								The SOAP standard describes elements necessary for communication, such as the “SOAP Envelope,” which encloses the actual content to be sent. This content is application-specific and is in this case defined by the WSDL file provided by tyntec. A simple XML parser can be used for extracting the data from the SOAP response.
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								WSDL file
							Element:br
								The WSDL file can be accessed on one of the URLs below, depending on whether HTTP or HTTPS is used.

								To implement and use Global Number Portability, you should have the call of a Web Service as defined by the SOAP specification (
							Element:a
								http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/
								) with the help of the provided WSDL file.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Furthermore, you need a computer system with a fixed IP address from where the SOAP call is initiated. This computer system must be reachable from the tyntec IP. For the fastest implementation and expert support from tyntec, it is strongly recommended that the Global Number Portability is implemented using:
