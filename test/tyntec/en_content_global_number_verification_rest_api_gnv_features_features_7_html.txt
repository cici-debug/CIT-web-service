								AlertSC notification

								On request
							Element:td
							Element:p
								With this feature, you will be notified when a handset that is originally turned off gets turned back on. Here is how it works:
							Element:ol
							Element:ol
							Element:li
								You query a phone number and receive a “phone turned off” response
							Element:li
								tyntec instructs the mobile operator to provide a notification when the phone number becomes available
							Element:li
							Element:span
								When tyntec receives the information that the phone is available, we will notify you.
							Element:p
								This functionality depends on the capabilities of each mobile operator’s infrastructure and is not guaranteed, so you might not receive AlertSC notifications from some mobile operators.
