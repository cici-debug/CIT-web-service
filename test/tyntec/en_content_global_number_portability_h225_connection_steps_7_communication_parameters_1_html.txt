								Communication parameters
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The following are the parameters for the communication:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								The request type is LocationRequest
							Element:li
								The IP and the port are displayed in the BIO document
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The most important parameters for each request are the unique requestSeqNum, which is used as the reference for the response, and the MSISDN which is queried. The MSISDN is given in the destinationInfo as aliasAddress in the form of dialedDigits. e.g.:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								destinationInfo { aliasAddress: dialedDigits: 0333031412151}
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The following is an example for such a request (parsed output):
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								RasMessage ::= locationRequest : { requestSeqNum 39, destinationInfo: Sequence of 1 Item(s): { aliasAddress: dialledDigits: 0333031412151 }, replyAddress: TransportAddress: { ip ‚0a030412‘H port 33743 }, sourceInfo: Sequence of 0 Item(s): { }, canMapAlias: false, canMapSrcAlias: false, }
