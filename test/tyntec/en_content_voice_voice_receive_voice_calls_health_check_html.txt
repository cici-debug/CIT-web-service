								To ensure that there is always a viable connection in place, tyntec performs systematic checks. This is done by sending SIP OPTIONS requests to the customer‘s equipment.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								As a default configuration, tyntec expects a reply back with a 200 OK response code to the SIP OPTIONS requests. In addition, other response codes can be configured upon the customer‘s request.
