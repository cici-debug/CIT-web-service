								tyntec’s Inter-Carrier Messaging Service (ICMS) SMPP interface is a service that enables you to exchange SMS with all operators listed on tyntec’s reach list by using the SMPP protocol. tyntec supports the SMPP protocol version 3.4.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Authentication is initated during the setup of the SMPP connection. After successful completion of the authentication, the session between your system and ours (i.e. the peers) is kept open and alive.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The connection and features are configurable, thanks to the flexibility provided by our SMPP interface. The following illustrates an example of the workflow for sending/receiving SMS:
