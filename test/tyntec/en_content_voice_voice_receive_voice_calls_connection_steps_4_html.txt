								Add a concrete SIP call flow including the SDP portions:

								A common scenario for the Voice Inbound service is the flow of a call on the telephony network that is directed to you. In this default case, tyntec’s platform will sent an INVITE request to the IP(s) you provide. This INVITE request contains all necessary information the caller gives, including, but not limited to, caller ID, calling party ID, privacy level or defer information.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You should answer this INVITE immediately. The most common case is a 100 Trying response, thus, informing tyntec that you have received the INVITE. You can reply with a 180 Ringing response, which tells tyntec to play a ring back tone for the caller. Another common reply is 200 OK, which informs tyntec‘s platform that you are ready to receive a call.

								After that, tyntec’s platform sends an ACK request to you, which initiates the media data that is transmitted via RTP over UDP.

								If the calling party ends the call, a BYE request is sent from the customer‘s service to tyntec. This will halt the media transport and it will be answered with a 200 OK response.
