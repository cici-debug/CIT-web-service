								Response Code 0 – Success
						Node:

								Although the response code ‘0’ is not explicitly returned, success is implied when the network operator information is returned.
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								With the delivery of MCC + MNC and TynTecID we ensure uniqueness in the transmission of the network operator information, regardless of any changes that may have taken place regarding the name of the operator.

								Response Code 1 – No Response
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Response Code ‘1’ indicates that the network did not return a response, e.g.:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								15-21088981464922+491239876543

								There are a number of reasons why a network may not return a response. Often, poor number quality results in the network being unable to respond. Check the quality of the number to ensure that it consists only of the ‘+’ sign and decimal digits; no other characters or spaces are permitted. If number quality is good, there may be a problem with the network; we recommend that you query again at a later time. Another possibility is that the number belongs to an operator that tyntec cannot reach.

								Response Code 2 – Error
						Node:
