								Functionality
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Freely configurable sender ID type
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								You can freely define the sender ID as alphanumeric, numeric or shortcode. An alphanumeric sender ID can have up to 11 characters.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Swap sender and receiver in the DLR
							Element:td
							Element:p
								On request
							Element:td
							Element:p
								In the tyntec DLRs, the sender and receiver parameters are set to the same values as in the matching message. If this feature is activated, the content is swapped, i.e. the sender parameter of the original message becomes the receiver in the DLR and the other way round. The former behavior is common practice in the industry, while the latter matches the SMPP 3.4 specifications.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Extended DLR
							Element:td
							Element:p
								On request
							Element:td
							Element:p
								If this feature is activated, the TON/NPI values are set in the deliver_sm PDU that delivers the DLR to you (MT). The TON/NPI values match the ones you originally set in the submit_sm.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								TON/NPI settings
							Element:td
							Element:p
								On request
							Element:td
							Element:p
								If this feature is activated, you can set TON/NPI for the originator. As an exception, tyntec will set the TON to 5 for an alphanumeric originator. If the feature is not activated, tyntec will set the TON/NPI parameters automatically based on the analysis of the originator.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Protocol ID / Over The Air (OTA)
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								This feature enables the setting of the protocol ID as per GSM 3.40 documentation. It is commonly used for sending binary SMS.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								GSM return codes
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The GSM return codes substitute the tyntec response codes with four-digit hexadecimal codes. This feature gives more visibility on the non-delivery reason. A list of GSM return codes is available in the Customer Lounge.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Intermediate DLRs
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The intermediate DLR is sent to you if the first delivery attempt of an SMS fails. By reading the GSM return code in it, you can identify the non-delivery reason. A message that cannot be delivered during the first attempt will have a “BUFFERD” state.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Dynamic sender ID replacement
							Element:td
							Element:p
								On request
							Element:td
							Element:p
								This feature can replace the original sender ID with a random numeric one. It is particularly useful to overcome certain sender ID restrictions.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Geographic time stamp
							Element:td
							Element:p
								On request
							Element:td
							Element:p
								This feature adapts the timestamp to the local time of the home network and not to the MSC. So, for example, if the subscriber is roaming, the message will not show local time, but home network time.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Concatenated SMS
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The maximum length of an SMS is 160 characters in GSM-7, 140 in ASCII and 70 in Unicode (UCS-2). This feature enables the transmission of messages over these lengths as a concatenation of several segments. You must split the concatenated message into segments and use a specific User Data Header (UDH) as described in the SMPP 3.4 documentation.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Deferred delivery
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The SMS can be scheduled for future delivery.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Validity setting
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The default SMS validity is 48 hours. If the first attempt fails, tyntec will make several delivery attempts during this timeframe. You can, however, set the validity to values lower than 48 hours.
							Element:p
								Especially for One-Time Password, we recommend setting the validity to several minutes. This will make the message expire when the content is no longer relevant and force more retries within a short time frame after sending the message, hence increasing the chance of delivery.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Number Portability check
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								tyntec checks if the recipient number is ported before each SMS delivery. The message is routed to the true home network.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Clear DLR text
							Element:td
							Element:p
								On request
							Element:td
							Element:p
								A standard DLR that we send to you contains the text of the original SMS. If preferred for security reasons, you can use this feature to request the removal of the original SMS text from the DLR.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								MCC/MNC and TTID of recipient operator
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Identifies the receiving operator in the DLR by its MCC/MNC and TTID (tyntec operator ID). The TLV field 0x203 is populated with the MCC/MNC and the TLV field 0x1401 with the TTID. If the Swap sender and receiver in the DLR feature is activated, then the TLV field 0x202 is populated with the MCC/MNC and the TLV field 0x1400 with the TTID.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Price in the DLR
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Shows the price applicable for the respective SMS. The TLV field 0x1402 contains the price, the field 0x1403 contains the currency (e.g. “EUR”) and the field 0x1404 contains the timestamp based on when the price became effective in SMPP time format.
