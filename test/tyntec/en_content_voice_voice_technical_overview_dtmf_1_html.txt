							Element:ul
							Element:li
								As SIP INFO requests (described in RFC 2976)
							Element:li
								As telephone-event packets in the RTP stream (described in RFC 2833)
							Element:li
								In-band as part of the audio stream (RTP)
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The in-band transmission method is the least recommended, because it is sensitive to audio compression and can only be used reliably in combination with G.711 (PCMA/PCMU). Please note that the list of supported methods may differ from country to country, when in doubt please consult with technical support.
