								imsi_ttid: tyntec operator ID of the subscription network (based on IMSI)
							Element:li
								imsi_c: Subscription network country (based on IMSI)
							Element:li
								e: SS7 network error code. This value is provided if it is available to tyntec. A value different than zero does not indicate a failed query. The error code parameter can be interpreted according to the error code documentation that tyntec provides.

								When to use the IMSI and the HLR parameters
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Usually the IMSI parameters (imsi_mcc, imsi_mnc and imsi_ttid) and the HLR parameters (hlr_mcc, hlr_mnc, hlr_ttid) are the same. In rare cases they can be different. The IMSI values are usually slightly more accurate, however they might be missing if tyntec cannot obtain them from the data sources in use.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In order to maximize both accuracy and success rates, we recommend the following implementation:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Check the IMSI parameters first and use them if they are present.
							Element:li
								If the IMSI values are absent, fall back on the HLR values.
