							Element:p
								The following are the parameters for the UDP communication:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								The record type is NAPTR
							Element:li
								The domain is e164.arpa
						Node:

								The most important parameters for each request are the unique id, which is used as the reference for the response, and the MSISDN that is queried. The MSISDN needs to be transformed using the following steps:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
								Check that the E.164 number is written in its full form, including the country code. Example: +1-51-45868291
							Element:li
								Remove all non-digit characters, with the exception of the leading ‚+‘. Example: +15145868291
							Element:li
								Remove all characters, with the exception of the digits. Example: 15145868291
							Element:li
								Put dots („.“) between each digit. Example: 1.5.1.4.5.8.6.8.2.9.1
							Element:li
								Reverse the order of the digits. Example: 1.9.2.8.6.8.5.4.1.5.1
							Element:li
								Append the string „.e164.arpa“ to the end. Example: 1.9.2.8.6.8.5.4.1.5.1.e164.arpa .
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								An example for such a request can be sent using e.g. the dig command:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								dig @195.162.239.181 IN NAPTR 1.9.2.8.6.8.5.4.1.5.1.e164.arpa
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								and would look like this:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
