								tyntec’s Global Number Verification minimizes message loss and unsuccessful call attempts with real-time phone number verification, providing key information on your users’ phone numbers, such as subscriber status and roaming data.
						Node:

							Element:p
								Global Number Verification is available with the Synchronous SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) API.
						Node:

								SOAP is a protocol used for exchanging messages over a computer network. The messages that are sent do not rely on the underlying transport protocol, which is HTTP Post in most cases (and in the specific case of the tyntec infrastructure).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The messages are structured as XML documents and are defined in two parts: the SOAP standard and the tyntec WSDL file.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								The SOAP standard describes elements necessary for communication, such as the “SOAP Envelope,” which encloses the actual content to be sent. This content is application-specific and is in this case defined by the WSDL file that tyntec provides. A simple XML parser can be used for extracting the data from the SOAP response.
							Element:li
								The WSDL file can be accessed at one of the following URLs, depending if HTTP or HTTPS is used:
							Element:br
							Element:a
								http://78.110.226.174:8979/soap/services/SyncSuperQueryService?wsdl
							Element:br
							Element:a
								https://78.110.226.174:9479/soap/services/SyncSuperQueryService?wsd
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To implement and use Global Number Verification Synchronous, you should implement the call of a Web Service as defined by the SOAP specification (
							Element:a
								http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/
								) with the help of the provided WSDL file.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Furthermore, the customer needs a computer system with a fixed IP address from where the SOAP call is initiated. This computer system must be reachable from the tyntec IP. For the fastest implementation and expert support from tyntec, we strongly recommend that the Global Number Verification is implemented using:
