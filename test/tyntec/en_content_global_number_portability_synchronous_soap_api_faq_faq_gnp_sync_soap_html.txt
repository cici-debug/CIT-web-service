								Q - The URL provided by tyntec for Global Number Portability doesn‘t work. What can be done?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A - Check the firewall settings to ensure that requests to URLs with a port number other than 80 are indeed permitted. If in doubt, please connect to the following URL (
							Element:a
								http://support.tyntec.biz:8968
								) and report to tyntec Customer Support the date and time of the attempted connection.

								Q - Why do I receive multiple Check Delivery Requests with the same ID?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A - In the event that your server is unable to process a request, e.g. an error generating the XML document, the Check Delivery Request will be resent. Please check your processes for receiving Check Delivery Requests.

								Q - I can send a request and receive back a message ID, but I do not get any results.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A - The URL to which results are to be directed must be registered at tyntec. Please check that the URL has the same IP address as the originating request (see also the second question in this FAQ section.) Also, please ensure that your SOAP service that accepts the results is running. The service must be kept running even if you have sent all requests, since there is a time delay between request and receipt of result. If you use a firewall, please ensure that tyntec‘s IP address (i.e., the IP address you sent the requests to) is accepted.

								I do not receive results for operator xyz any more.
						Node:

								A - The operator’s name may have changed, while you are still using a transcription table based on the names of operators. Please refer to a transcription table containing MCC +MNC.

								Q - Why do I receive an authorization failure?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A - An authorization failure can be caused by an incorrect username and/or password. Please contact tyntec Support to verify your user details. If you have a test account and have previously been able to send requests successfully you may have reached your test message limit.

								Q - I receive the same Check Delivery Request repeatedly, or results come in very slowly. What can I do?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A - There are two possibilities for receiving multiple Check Delivery Requests:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								1) tyntec received a Check Delivery Response with an error message included, or
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								2) There was a problem in the communication process.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In the case of an error message in a Check Delivery Response, the Check Delivery Request will be resent, regardless of the content of the error message. If for some reason you no longer wish to receive a certain Check Delivery Request, please return a Check Delivery Response without an error message. An improperly structured Check Delivery Response is the most common cause for a communication problem. The Check Delivery Response may have incorrect syntax that could not be parsed by the XML compiler. Alternatively, a CheckDelivery Response may never have been sent successfully. In either case, the Check Delivery Request will be resent, since it cannot be determined whether the Check Delivery Request has been successfully received.

								Please make sure that your receiving service returns a proper SOAP envelope with a proper Check Delivery Response included in the SOAP body.

								Q - I send Check Requests but why do I always get an error back?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A - This can be due to a number of reasons, including:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								1) You have not supplied a username and/or password. Please make sure that you supply both in the HTTP
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Header in the Basic Authorization Scheme (Refer to RFC 2616)
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								2) The supplied username and/or password are invalid: Please check if you have mistyped the username and/or password provided to you
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								3) The supplied number is not a valid phone number; the number must consist only of digits (except a leading +). Any other characters including spaces will not be accepted.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								4) Our service cannot parse the Check Request. Please verify that the Check Request is equivalent to the example request given in this API guide (refer to Section 4,
							Element:a
								Step 1
								). If you have created your program/service with an automatic tool and the WSDL file supplied by tyntec, this should not happen
