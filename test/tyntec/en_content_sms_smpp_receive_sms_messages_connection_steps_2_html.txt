								After entering the connectivity parameters provided by tyntec (IP, port, username, password) into the SMPP client, a connection between your system and tyntec will be established using one of the bind operations described above. For receiving SMS from tyntec, a receiver or transceiver session is needed. The session needs to stay open in order for us to be able to deliver the messages to you.
