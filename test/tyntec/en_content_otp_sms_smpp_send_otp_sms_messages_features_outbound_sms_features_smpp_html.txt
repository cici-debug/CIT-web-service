								Functionality
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Freely configurable sender ID type
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								You can freely define the sender ID as alphanumeric, numeric or shortcode. An alphanumeric sender ID can have up to 11 characters.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Swap sender and receiver in the DLR
							Element:td
							Element:p
								On request
							Element:td
							Element:p
								In the tyntec DLRs, the sender and receiver parameters are set to the same values as in the matching message. If this feature is activated, the content is swapped, i.e. the sender parameter of the original message becomes the receiver in the DLR and the other way round. The former behaviour is common practice in the industry, while the latter matches the SMPP 3.4 specifications.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Extended DLR
							Element:td
							Element:p
								On request
							Element:td
							Element:p
								If this feature is activated, the TON/NPI values are set in the deliver_sm PDU that delivers the DLR to you (MT). The TON/NPI values match the ones you originally set in the submit_sm.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								TON/NPI settings
							Element:td
							Element:p
								On request
							Element:td
							Element:p
								If this feature is activated, you can set TON/NPI for the originator. As an exception, tyntec will set the TON to 5 for an alphanumeric originator. If the feature is not activated, tyntec will automatically set the TON/NPI parameters based on the analysis of the originator.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Protocol ID / Over The Air (OTA)
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								This feature enables the setting of the protocol ID as per GSM 3.40 documentation. It is commonly used for sending binary SMS.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								GSM return codes
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The GSM return codes substitute the tyntec response codes with four-digit hexadecimal codes. This feature gives more visibility on the non-delivery reason. A list of GSM return codes is available in the Customer Lounge.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Intermediate DLRs
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The intermediate DLR is sent to you if the first delivery attempt of an OTP SMS fails. By reading the GSM return code in it, the non-delivery reason can be identified. A message that cannot be delivered at the first attempt will have a “BUFFERD” state.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Dynamic sender ID replacement
							Element:td
							Element:p
								On request
							Element:td
							Element:p
								This feature can replace the original sender ID with a random numeric one. It is particularly useful to overcome certain sender ID restrictions.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Geographic time stamp
							Element:td
							Element:p
								On request
							Element:td
							Element:p
								This feature adapts the time stamp to the local time of the home network. This is not linked to the MSC, so if the subscriber is roaming the message will not show local time, but home network time.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Concatenated SMS
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The maximum length of an SMS is 160 characters in GSM-7, 140 in ASCII and 70 in Unicode (UCS-2). This feature enables the transmission of messages over this length as a concatenation of several segments. You need to split the concatenated message into segments and use a specific User Data Header (UDH) as described in the SMPP 3.4 documentation.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Deferred delivery
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The SMS can be scheduled for delivery in the future.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Validity setting
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The default SMS validity is 48 hours. tyntec makes several delivery attempts during this timeframe if the first one fails. You can set the validity to values lower than 48 hours.
							Element:p
								Especially for One Time Password, we recommend setting the validity to several minutes. This will make the message expire when the content is no longer relevant and will force more retries within a short time frame after sending the message, hence increasing the chance of delivery.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Number Portability check
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								tyntec checks if the recipient number is ported before each SMS delivery. The message is routed to the true home network.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Clear DLR text
							Element:td
							Element:p
								On request
							Element:td
							Element:p
								A standard DLR that we send to you contains the text of the original SMS. For security reasons, you might want us to remove this original SMS text from the DLR.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								MCC/MNC and TTID of recipient operator
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Identifies the receiving operator in the DLR by its MCC/MNC and TTID (tyntec operator ID). The TLV field 0x203 is populated with the MCC/MNC and the TLV field 0x1401 with the TTID. If the Swap sender and receiver in the DLR feature is activated, then the TLV field 0x202 is populated with the MCC/MNC and the TLV field 0x1400 with the TTID
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Price in the DLR
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Default
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Shows the price applicable for the respective SMS. The TLV field 0x1402 contains the price, the field 0x1403 contains the currency (e.g. “EUR”) and the field 0x1404 contains the timestamp since when the price became effective in SMPP time format.
