								Step 6 – AlertSC delivery response
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The receipt of the AlertSC Delivery Request must be acknowledged to tyntec. Please note that this response must be delivered via the HTTP response to the previous HTTP request. To acknowledge successful delivery, please send back a response in the following format:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								<tyn:AlertSCDeliverResponse xmlns:tyn=“http://www.tyntec.biz/“> </tyn:AlertSCDeliverResponse>
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:span
								If there is an issue in the processing of the response from tyntec, a message indicating an error will be returned. For example, returning the following message will trigger a retry from tyntec:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The receipt of successful results must be acknowledged by your HTTP server by terminating the stream. Failure to terminate the stream will result in a re-delivery from tyntec. Generally, a Web Services framework will automatically close the stream. We recommend that you do not use a hand-written parser for processing SOAP messages, but rather an automated system such as Castor or any other XML parsing technology.
