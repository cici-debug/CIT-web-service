								Step 4 - Acknowledge delivery receipt
						Node:

							Element:p
								You need to acknowledge the receipt of the DLR with a HTTP 200 (OK) as a response to the previous HTTP request submitted by tyntec to you. If you donâ€™t acknowledge the receipt of the DLR, tyntec will retry to send it to you.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If there is an issue in the processing of the response from tyntec, a message indicating an error should be returned. For example, returning an error code from the 4xx range will trigger a retry from tyntec.
