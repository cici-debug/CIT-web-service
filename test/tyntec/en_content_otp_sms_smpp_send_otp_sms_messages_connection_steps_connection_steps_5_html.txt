											Step 1 - Setting up a session using a bind request
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											After entering the connectivity parameters provided by tyntec (IP, port, username, password) into the SMPP client, a connection between your system and tyntec will be established using one of the bind operations described in Interface Information. If you want to be able to send OTP SMS and to receive the DLRs, you need either one transceiver session or one transmitter and one receiver session. The same bandwidth will be available to you no matter how many sessions you establish.

											Step 2 - Acknowledge bind request
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											After tyntec receives a bind request with the correct authentication parameters, a bind_resp will be issued and the session is available for communication.

											Step 3 – Submitting a message
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Messages are submitted to tyntec using the submit_sm operation. The submit_sm operation and the PDU are described in detail in the SMPP 3.4 documentation. Here are the most common parameters and their recommended values:

										Element:ul
										Element:li
											dest_addr_ton: 1
										Element:li
											dest_addr_npi: 1
										Element:li
											dest_addr: receiver number in international format, i.e. with leading “+” or “00” plus country code.

											Everything. All European, Greek, Arabic, Chinese, Thai, Kanji and various special characters. Display on the handset differs strongly and may depend on setting of the handset (example: Chinese characters may not be displayed if the interface is set to European display). Note: a Unicode SMS may only contain 70 characters.

											Step 4 - Acknowledge submitted message
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											After tyntec received a correct submit_sm request, a submit_sm_resp will be issued. The submit_sm_resp contains the message ID in the message_id parameter, which is a unique identifier for each message. It may vary in format and length. The submission of the message to tyntec is finalized with the issuing of the submit_sm_resp. The messages are stored in the tyntec SMSC and will be delivered to the receiver. If the initial delivery attempt is not successful – e.g. the receiving mobile phone is turned off – further attempts of delivering the message will be made. The message will be kept in the tyntec SMSC for up to 48 hours, after which it will expire.

											Step 5 – Submitting a delivery receipt (DLR), optional
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Once a message reaches a final status (delivered, cannot be delivered, expired), tyntec creates a delivery receipt if this is requested in the initial submit_sm. The DLR will be submitted to you via an existing receiver or transceiver session using the deliver_sm operation. The delivery receipt itself is included in the text parameter of the deliver_sm PDU.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The tyntec deliver_sm content of the source and destination parameters match the values of the original submit_sm. This behaviour is different to the SMPP specification but commonly used. Upon request, tyntec can change this behaviour to match the SMPP 3.4 specification.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The text in the deliver_sm will be in the following format:
									Node:

										Element:p
										Element:strong
										Element:span
											Possible values for DDDDDDD:
									Node:

										Element:pre
											id:<Tyntec‘s messageid> sub:001 dlvrd:001 submit date:YYMMDDhhmm done date:YYMMDDhhmm stat:DDDDDDD err:E Text: . . . . . . . . .
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											DELIVRD – message was successfully delivered
										Element:li
											UNDELIV – message could not be delivered, e.g. due to unknown number
										Element:li
											EXPIRED – message could not be delivered within validity period, maximum 48 hours
										Element:li
											REJECTD – message was rejected, e.g. because of incorrect format
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:p
										Element:strong
											Possible values for E:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											001 or 013 - message was delivered, used with DDDDDDD = DELIVRD
										Element:li
											002 – message was not delivered, used with DDDDDDD = UNDELIV
										Element:li
											006 or 020 – message expired, used with DDDDDDD = EXPIRED
										Element:li
											010 – message was rejected, used with DDDDDDD = REJECTD
										Element:li
											012 - Message could not yet be delivered. tyntec is still retrying. This is used for intermediate DLRs.

											Step 6 – Acknowledge submitted DLR
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You need to acknowledge the receipt of a deliver_sm with a deliver_sm_resp, otherwise tyntec will keep on resending the deliver_sm.
