								tyntec’s Global Number Verification (GNV) minimizes message loss and unsuccessful call attempts with real-time phone number verification, providing key information on your users’ phone numbers, such as subscriber status and roaming data.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Global Number Verification is available with the Asynchronous SOAP API.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								SOAP is a protocol used for exchanging messages over a computer network. The messages that are sent do not rely on the underlying transport protocol, which is HTTP post in most cases (and in the specific case of the tyntec infrastructure).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The messages themselves are structured as XML documents and are defined in two parts:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								SOAP standard
							Element:br
								The SOAP standard describes elements necessary for communication, such as the “SOAP Envelope” which encloses the actual content to be sent. This content is application-specific and is in this case defined by the WSDL file provided by tyntec. A simple XML parser can be used for extracting the data from the soap response.

						(type) c

								WSDL file

								The WSDL file can be accessed on one of the URLs below, depending if HTTP or HTTPS is used:

						Node:

								To implement and use Global Number Verification, you should have certain resources:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								The call of a Web Service as defined by the SOAP specification (
							Element:a
								http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/
								) with the help of the provided WSDL file.
							Element:li
								A receiving Web Service on the server side in order to accept requests to deliver the results (CheckDeliverRequest, defined in the WSDL file). This is only necessary for the asynchronous interface.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Furthermore, you need a computer system with a fixed IP address from where the SOAP call is initiated, where the Web Service runs and which accepts the results if using the asynchronous API (Check Delivery Requests). This computer system must be reachable from the tyntec IP. For the fastest implementation and expert support from tyntec, we recommend implementing the GNV using:
