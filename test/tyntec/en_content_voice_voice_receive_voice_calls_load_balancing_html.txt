								As an optional feature, you can have tyntec distribute the SIP traffic to different servers of yours. This way you can use many servers to process the incoming calls. tyntec checks periodically the availability of the your servers with SIP OPTIONS requests. If no answer is received to a series of these health checks, the server is marked as unavailable and no new calls will be forwarded to it. The server‘s availability is checked continuously. Once tyntec‘s OPTIONS requests are answered, the server is considered to be available (again) and calls will be forwarded to it.
