								tyntec’s Global Number Portability resolves number portability by obtaining data directly from local number portability databases and live network information from across the globe.

							Element:p
								Global Number Portability is available with the ENUM API, which is a protocol that uses the Internet DNS system to translate E.164 (i.e. ordinary) telephone numbers into IP addresses. It is based on UDP communication by default, which in general means that there’s no guaranteed package delivery.

								The authentication is based on your IP. We recommend a VPN connection to increase the connection security.

								There is no unique identifier (like the message ID used by other tyntec products). The identification of individual queries is based on the phone number queried, the IP the query came from and the query timestamp.

								tyntec can customize the maximum time used before a result is returned (timeout parameter). If tyntec does not get a response within this timeframe, you will get an error response.
