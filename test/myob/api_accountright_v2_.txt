											Version 2 of the AccountRight Live API builds on the work started with v1. Right from the start we heard some very valuable input and feedback from our developers which we have

											listened to
											and have some great improvements in store for Version 2 that we are excited about.

											The AccountRight Live API expects a custom header which is used for version management. You simply pass
										Element:code
											x-myobapi-version:
											in your header to tell us which version you wish to use. More information on headers can be found
										Element:a
											here
											.
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:p
											Here's an example of a header that calls the version 2 api - note the
										Element:code
											x-myobapi-version:
											is set to
										Element:code
											v2
											.
