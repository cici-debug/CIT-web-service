											How to reference the versions
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The AccountRight Live API expects a custom header which is used for version management. You simply pass
										Element:code
											x-myobapi-version:
											in your header to tell us which version you wish to use. More information on headers can be found
										Element:a
											here
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Here's an example of a header that calls the version 2 api - note the
										Element:code
											x-myobapi-version:
											is set to
										Element:code
											v2
											.

									Node:

											The AccountRight Live API v2 introduces immutable GUIDs for records ensuring cleaner tracking of entities across systems.

										Element:p
											AccountRight Live API v2 introduces the concept of a
										Element:code
											DisplayID
											which is the ID used for any given endpoint when displayed in the AccountRight Live application. This can contain different information depending on the endpoint you are referencing. Here's some examples.
									Node:
									(type) c

												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:h4
														Contacts
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														All contact cards will now include
													Element:code
														DisplayID
														which is the card id value of the contact.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														This contact displayID will now look like
													Element:code
														"DisplayID": "CUS00001"
									Node:

												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:h4
														Accounts
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														All accounts will now include
													Element:code
														DisplayID
														which is the full account number including the separator.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														This account displayID will now look like
													Element:code
														"DisplayID": "1-1100"

												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:h4
														General Journal
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														All general journal entries will now include
													Element:code
														DisplayID
														which is the journal number.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														This general journal displayID will now look like
													Element:code
														"DisplayID": "GJ000001"

											Making data retrieval easier
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											AccountRight Live API v2 will now include objects nested within certain endpoints - referenced by a foreign key. For example an account endpoint carries a foreign key to the tax code table.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Version 1 simply returned the
										Element:code
											TaxCodeID
											in this format
										Element:code
											"TaxCodeId": "N-T"
											. Version 2 will fetch more data and return the following as part of the account response
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:br
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											"TaxCode": { "UID": "d2e0a576-3249-4797-8ca5-e1c87117da98", "Code": "N-T", "URI": "
										Element:span
											{domain}
											/AccountRight/
										Element:span
											{cfguid}
											/GeneralLedger/TaxCode/{UID}" },

											Updated to /personal/
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											AccountRight Live API v2 sees a change to the
										Element:code
											/PersonalCard/
											endpoint. This is now in line with the other contact end points and now is called simply
										Element:code
											/personal/
											.

											Grouping common endpoints
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Probably the biggest change to the AccountRight Live API with version 2 is the introduction of
										Element:strong
											endpoint collections
											. As the team looked to introduce more functional endpoints like a new
										Element:code
											/contact
											endpoint, it made sense to group endpoints into common accounting tasks.
