											How to request a PDF
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Firstly we need to tell the API we want to access the pdf format, this can be achieved two different ways, you can pass an additional HEADER
										Element:code
											Accept: Application/PDF
											or explicitly tell the API to return the PDF format at the end of your URL request
										Element:code
											?format=pdf
											You only need to use one of these methods to complete successful requests.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											For information on templates and the templatename keyword
										Element:strong
											HTTP GET
											is the only supported method, to make a request your
										Element:strong
											URL
											should look like
										Element:code
										Element:a
											{cf_uri}
											/Sale/Invoice/
										Element:span
											{type}
											/
										Element:span
											{uid}
											/?format=pdf&templatename=Pre-Printed Invoice

											Which sale invoice types are supported?
									Node:

										Element:p
											Rendering sale invoices into pdf format can be processed for the
										Element:strong
											Item, Service, TimeBilling
											and
										Element:strong
											Professional
											layout types. The miscellaneous invoice type does not have printing capabilities in AccountRight Live.
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:p
										Element:strong
											Please note:
										Element:code
											/Sale/Invoice/
											is not supported because a template can only be uniquely identified using the invoice layout type.

											A template parameter
										Element:code
											templatename=
											can be passed to explicitly tell the API which custom form to render the invoice with i.e.
										Element:code
											templatename=Pre-Printed Invoice
											. This is not mandatory to include as the sale layout and printed form set on the customer contact card will default instead.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If the customer contact card does not contain a default sale layout and printed form, the template will default to the standard AccountRight Live
										Element:strong
											Plain Paper Invoice
											for the invoice type the sale belongs to.

											To retrieve a list of sale custom form templates (AccountRight 2014.3 cloud, desktop 2014.4) please refer to the new

											Each sale layout type has it's own specific set of templates and forms that are unique to it, therefore if you create a custom form template for an invoice type of item, you cannot use this to print or render a service or professional invoice, only item.

											Note:
											custom form template names are not case sensitive when passing through.
