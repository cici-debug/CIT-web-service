											HTTP PUT
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Use the PUT method to update an existing entry in the database. For example, to update a customer contact record with new information you would use the PUT method.

											HTTP POST
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Use the POST method to add a new entry to the database, whether it already exists or not. For example, you might use the POST method to add a customer to the company file. If the customer you're adding already exists, another record for the customer will be added.

											If you want to:
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											add a new record, use the HTTP POST method.
										Element:li
											edit a record that already exists within the company file, use the HTTP PUT method. This will update the content of the existing record.
										Element:li
											add a record even if it already exists, use the POST method. This is known as a
										Element:em
											non-idempotent
											method. Repeating the POST call will add the record again.
