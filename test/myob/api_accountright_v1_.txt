											After releasing v1 we received a lot of great feedback from the development community and decided that we'd create a new version of the AccountRight Live API to address much of this feedback. This has resulted in us releasing the
										Element:a
											AccountRight Live API v2
											.
									Node:

										Element:p
											Version 1 is now officialy deprecated and will no longer be updated or worked on (outside of critical bugs). All development and refinement work will now continue on Version 2.
									Node:

										Element:p
											We
										Element:strong
											strongly
											recommend you switch to the
										Element:a
											AccountRight Live v2
											api instead of v1.

											Will you release v3 in 6 months?
									Node:

										Element:p
										Element:strong
											No
											! We had to version the AccountRight Live API as a number of the changes required would have been breaking changes. The decision to version was not taken lightly and the foundation laid in v2 means we can now extend and enhance without requiring version changes.
