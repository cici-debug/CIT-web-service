											We built this SDK with two purposes in mind. 1) to help you our developers have an easy to consume tool to help you code and 2) for our own internal requirements for testing the API. Yes that's right we consume this SDK ourselves. It's part of our build pipeline so you know it's solid and it'll be updated constantly to support the fresh features in the API.
