											The AccountRight Live API v2 by default returns
										Element:a
											JSON
											and you don't need to explicitly tell the API to return in this format.
									Node:

										Element:p
											However if you like to be sure you are receiving JSON you can pass the
										Element:code
											?format=json
											flag in the URL.

											Note if you are passing data back to the AccountRight Live API using
										Element:a
											PUT or POST
											format you must set
										Element:code
											'Content-Type: application/json'
											in your header.

											It some cases it makes sense to be able to return the data in a HTML format. If you browse the local URL eg:
										Element:code
											http://localhost:8080/
											in a web browser you are returned a simple webpage allowing you to navigate through the AccountRight Live API. To force this format you simply pass the
										Element:code
											?format=html
											flag in the URL.
