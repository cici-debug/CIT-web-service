									Node:

										Element:p
											Our VB.NET sample shows you how to use the new .Net SDK released with version 2 of the API. The sample demonstrates how to use the SDK to connect to a local and/or cloud server including authenticating via OAuth 2. Functionally the sample displays the company files allowing a user to login as well as how to support paging using the API through the Invoice endpoint. The sample also shows how to view and create service invoices.

											The sample is ready to work against the local server but can also connect to the cloud server by simply providing your developer key and secret with the redirect URL set to http://desktop. Instructions to get started with the sample can be found at the blog post
