											MYOB AccountRight Live is a
										Element:strong
											hybrid
											product, this means that the data the API allows you to access and work with, can live either on the users computer (local computer or one on a network in their office) or it can live in the MYOB Cloud.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This gives you a developer two choices when thinking about working with our app. Will your solution (or integration) access the API via the desktop, the cloud or both?
										Element:br
										Element:br
											For example: if you are building a Windows 8 Reporting app, then you'll want to access the API via the desktop. If you intended to build an online reporting tool then you'll want to access the API via the cloud (You might also consider a desktop connector to bring data from the desktop to your app in the cloud).
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The two API's are actually
										Element:strong
											identical
											, the only difference is in the
										Element:a
											authentication headers needed for the Cloud
											.

											Access the API via the desktop
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Using this API is really simple, as long as you have MYOB AccountRight 2013 or 2014 installed you can start developing against the API.
										Element:br
										Element:br
											AccountRight 2014 provides you with two different installers to choose from, firstly there is the lighter framed client
										Element:strong
											PC version
											that gives you an add-on connector to access the desktop API. Secondly a
										Element:strong
											Server
											build is available for those users that host company files over a network and need to access the API desktop service in network mode. More information on these installers can be
										Element:a
											found here
											.
										Element:br
										Element:br
											For anyone that may be using an older version of AccountRight 2013 i.e. 2013.5, you may need to manually install the API service. To do so you can find and run the API installer executable from
										Element:code
											C:\Program Files (x86)\MYOB\AccountRight\API_Installer
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											The next step
											is to open up your browser (we recommend a modern browser like Google Chrome) and enter the following address:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:br
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											http://localhost:8080/accountright/
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:br
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This should open up a webpage and show you a table of the company files that reside on this computer, with details such as ID, Name, LibraryPath, ProductVersion and more. Pay particular note of the ID, as this is the GUID that identifies the company file. You will use this in the URL of every subsequent call.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											Note
											: the API when accessed via a browser returns HTML, with clickable URIs included so that you can easily explore the data available to you. We recommend that your application uses the JSON format. For more
										Element:a
											information on formats within the API, click here
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											Additionally
											: should you want to access a local network computer with the company files on it (AccountRight 2014 Server build required), simply change the URL to the following
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:br
									Node:

									Node:

											Before you can start working on a new app, or make your existing app work with the AccountRight Cloud API, you first need to register your app and receive an API key, and an API secret. These are used when
										Element:a
											authenticating your application
											and are
										Element:a
											set in the headers
											for all calls to the API.
									Node:

											Follow these steps to get started with the AccountRight Cloud API:

														Before anything happens you'll need to authenticate, which allows the user of your app to assign access permissions to your application. This is done using OAuth Authentication and
													Element:a
														the steps are spelled out on our authentication page

														Once you have your access token, simply set the headers on every call, and pass these as you make the calls to the URLs you are requesting.
