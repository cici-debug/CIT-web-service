											You’ll firstly need to ensure you have a
										Element:strong
											NuGet plugin
											installed for your development environment, they are openly available to download online from the web. Our vb.net and c# samples consuming the SDK use a plugin for MS Visual Studio 2012.

											Installing the SDK package using the MS Visual Studio NuGet plugin can be done
										Element:strong
											two different ways
											, firstly you can use the
										Element:strong
											NuGet Package Manager
											(screenshot below) which is the preferred method.
