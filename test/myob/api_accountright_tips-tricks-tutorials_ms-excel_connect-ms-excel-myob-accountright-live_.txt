					One of the great things about the

					ODBC
					driver that was present in MYOB AccountRight Classic was that you could easily connect other services to it & extract data. One of these examples was using the ODBC to pull data into Excel for further manipulation, reporting generation and such like.

				Element:p
					Can I still pull data into Excel to create my own reports?
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The answer is
				Element:strong
					Yes
					and this tutorial will show you a simple way to extract data from your local AccountRight 2013 datafile into Microsoft Excel. You do this by using the AccountRight Live API (Application Programming Interface). Note: this tutorial focuses on desktop data files, not cloud files.

								Step 1: Install the AccountRight Live API
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								First step in integrating Excel to you AccountRight 2013 datafile is to install the AccountRight Live API. Head to
							Element:code
								C:\Program Files\MYOB\AccountRight\API_Installer
								on your computer and then run the installer called
							Element:code
								MYOB.AccountRight.API.Bootstrapper.exe
								. This will step you through the installation process.

								Step 2: Connecting API via a Web browser
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Right the API is installed. Before we connect to Excel, lets check we can get a list of the company files available in the local library. We can do that by using any web-browser installed on your computer. You simply visit this url
							Element:code
								http://localhost:8080/accountright/
								(if you already have the API installed
							Element:a
								click this link
								).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								What about network files?
							Element:br
								If you normally use MYOB to connect to a library stored over a network, simply change the URL to
							Element:code
								http://[IP ADDRESS OF COMPUTER TO ACCESS]:8080/accountright/
								- you just need the IP address of the computer which has MYOB AccountRight Live and the API installed on it.

										Element:p
											Once you have identified the company file you would like to access, you can simply click on the URL of the file you are trying to open. As you'll know, each company file (or data file) has a Username and Password associated with it. You will need to log into the file, the browser will prompt you, enter the company file user name and password that you use when opening the file in AccountRight.

											API Endpoints
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Now we come to a concept called 'EndPoints'. These are the parts of the API that return data.
										Element:strong
											Note
											unlike ODBC the API is not a direct or 1:1 match for the database, rather it is a representation of the features in the application.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To identify each specific company file, we use the idea of a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier). GUID is a unique number used as an identifier and each company file created will have its own unique
										Element:code
											GUID
											. You will notice once you start to look into a company file, the URL now contains this GUID.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The image below shows you a list of the endpoints and
										Element:a
											if you would like a list of the v2 API endpoints head over to this page
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you clicked into a company file and logged in you should now have all the list of all available endpoints like above.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Currently there are 2 API versions you can access and the default is set to version 1 when accessing the API. We recommend you use
										Element:a
											API v2
											, it has more endpoints like Invoice, Job, Category etc. and is more detailed than
										Element:a
											API v1
											. To access API v2 all you need to do is add
										Element:code
											?api-version=v2
											in the URL.
										Element:strong
											Note
											: API v2 is available for AccountRight 2013.3 and above.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You will now be able see all the endpoints you can access via the AccountRight Live API.

								Step 3: Getting Data into Excel
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In Microsoft Excel click through to the Data tab on the ribbon. Here you will find a button titled
							Element:strong
								From Web
								- click this
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A New Web Query windows will open and here in the Address area copy across the URL from the web browser for the endpoint you would like to import into Excel. You will need to specify two additional parameters in the URL for Excel to import the data.
							Element:code
								api-version=v2
								for API v2 endpoints and
							Element:code
								format=html
								for the data to import into excel in the right format.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Before you click on Import check that your URL query looks something like this
							Element:br
							Element:code
								http://localhost:8080/AccountRight/c0196658-e0e4-4e6a-a5b5-046891a82cc7/Sale/Invoice/Item/?api-version=v2&format=html

										Element:p
											You will be require to log into the company file. Excel will prompt you for these details so simply type your AccountRight user id & password you use to login into the company file.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Once authenticated you should be able to import the data into Microsoft Excel (v2010 and above)
