											The AccountRight Live API itself is built to the standard REST specification. This means a developer wishing to consume the AccountRight Live API, either on desktop or in the cloud, is
										Element:strong
											free to choose any language
											which supports
										Element:strong
											consumption of REST based web-services
											.

											To consume the AccountRight Live API, a developer simply chooses the language & platform that works best for them and they then communicate with the API over HTTP.

											I want to use the desktop API service
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When in the desktop environment AccountRight Live runs a local API service over HTTP (generally found at
										Element:code
											http://localhost:8080
											) which enables a local application to communicate with the locally served API.This
										Element:strong
											API service
											then in turn communicates to the AccountRight Live application.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											There are some minimum software requirements for running this
										Element:strong
											API service
											as part of AccountRight Live.

														Clarification
												Node:

												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Just to clarify, you
													Element:strong
														do NOT
														need .net 4.5
													Element:strong
														to consume the API
														.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														If you wish to have the
													Element:strong
														AccountRight Live API service
														run in a local environment, this computer must have .net 4.5 in order for the API Service to run alongside AccountRight Live. Your application however can run in any language that can consume a REST based API.
