											SDK Contracts
									Node:

										Element:p
											The SDK Contracts deliver a hierarchical representation of the
										Element:a
											JSON
											definitions available for all AccountRight API endpoints.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											These are nested into a series of classes that unpack the resources inside each entity. Looking at the online documentation for an entity provides the full elements (field) schema broken down in its entirety with nested objects included.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Illustrated within the documentation are required fields that are mandatory as part of a
										Element:strong
											POST (Insert)
											and
										Element:strong
											PUT (Update)
											operation along with read-only elements. These are highlighted with relevant icons beside the element types.

											Going back to the customer contact example introduced with
										Element:a
											SDK services
											, you’ll need to additionally include the Contact contracts in your code in order to start working with the resource:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:code
											using MYOB.AccountRight.SDK.Contracts.Version2.Contact;
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:br
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:br
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Simple example of declaring a new customer use the following:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:code
											var customers = new Customer()
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:br
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:br
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This will allow you to delve into the elements that are accessible to this contract.

											Looking through the
										Element:a
											customer endpoint online documentation
											provides you with the full resource schema, this identifies the many nested objects inside the entity which encompass their own contract classes and reference links.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											For example we have the following when using customer:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:br
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											- SellingDetails
											and the
										Element:strong
											CustomerSellingDetails
											contract
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											- PaymentDetails
											and the
										Element:strong
											CustomerPaymentDetails
											contract
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											- Credit
											and the
										Element:strong
											CustomerCredit
											contract
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											- Addresses
											array that has an Address contract used for all contact types i.e. Customer, Supplier, Employee
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											- TaxCode/FreightTaxCode
											requires the
										Element:strong
											TaxCodeLink
											which acts as a reference to the
										Element:strong
											GeneralLedger.TaxCode
											entity
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											- IncomeAccount
											requires the
										Element:strong
											AccountLink
											which acts as a reference to the
										Element:strong
											GeneralLedger.Account
											entity
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:br
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Unpacking these different contracts and referencing them against the online endpoint documentation is designed to demonstrate the relationships and just exactly what each resource comprises of.
