											There are a few important core classes that require some detail before jumping straight into the code snippets and examples, these are covered off in the table below:
									Node:

										Element:table
										Element:tbody
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:strong
											Class
										Element:td
										Element:strong
											Description
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											ApiConfiguration
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The
										Element:strong
											APIConfiguration
											is a simple class container that allows you to hold basic API configuration properties for you application. These include the APIs base url which can consist of:
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											- http://localhost:8080/accountright
											for localhost
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											- http://[IP ADDRESS OF COMPUTER TO ACCESS]:8080/accountright/
											for network mode
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											- https://api.myob.com/accountright
											for the cloud
										Element:p
											There are additional properties for the cloud apiBaseUrl including
										Element:strong
											clientId, clientSecret
											and
										Element:strong
											redirectUrl
											which are all related to OAuth authentication.
										Element:code
											public ApiConfiguration(string clientId, string clientSecret, string redirectUrl, string apiBaseUrl =
										Element:br
											"https://api.myob.com/accountright", bool generateUris = true);
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											CompanyFileService
										Element:td
										Element:p
											A service class that is used to fetch all available AccountRight company files. The 3 main parameters of note here are:
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											- configuration
											(configuration required to communicate with the API service)
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											- webRequestFactory
											(leave as null but can provide a mock class for automation testing purposes)
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											- keyService
											(implementation of a service that stores tokens required for OAuth and the cloud apiBaseUrl)
										Element:code
											public CompanyFileService(IApiConfiguration configuration, IWebRequestFactory webRequestFactory = null, IOAuthKeyService
										Element:br
											keyService = null);
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											CompanyFileCredentials
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Another simple class container which stores company file credentials. These are separate from OAuth and are the equivalent of the AccountRight company file login details. Initialise an instance of this class to pass both the username and password in string format.
										Element:code
											public CompanyFileCredentials(string username, string password);
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											SimpleOAuthKeyService
										Element:td
										Element:p
											A simple OAuth key service that uses the
										Element:strong
											IOAuthKeyService
											interface for classes that will store and retrieve OAuthTokens, this is used in memory only so it will not store tokens between sessions, other storage options can be implemented to extend this.
										Element:code
											public class SimpleOAuthKeyService : IOAuthKeyService
										Element:br
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											OAuthService
										Element:td
										Element:p
											Service class that provides the available interactions with the OAuth server, this includes instantiating the OAuth configuration to which you can retrieve and refresh OAuth tokens required to communicate with the cloud apiBaseUrl.
										Element:code
											public OAuthService(IApiConfiguration configuration, IWebRequestFactory factory = null);
										Element:br
										Element:br
										Element:code
											public OAuthTokens GetTokens(string code); //(Synchronous)
										Element:br
										Element:br
										Element:code
											public OAuthTokens RenewTokens(OAuthTokens oauthTokens); //(Synchronous)
										Element:br
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:p
										Element:strong
