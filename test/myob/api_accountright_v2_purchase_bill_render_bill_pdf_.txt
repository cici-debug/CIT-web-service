											How to request a PDF
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Firstly we need to tell the API we want to access the pdf format, this can be achieved two different ways, you can pass an additional HEADER
										Element:code
											Accept: Application/PDF
											or explicitly tell the API to return the PDF format at the end of your URL request
										Element:code
											?format=pdf
											You only need to use one of these methods to complete successful requests.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											For information on templates and the templatename keyword
										Element:strong
											HTTP GET
											is the only supported method, to make a request your
										Element:strong
											URL
											should look like
										Element:code
										Element:span
											{cf_uri}
											/Purchase/Bill/
										Element:span
											{type}
											/
										Element:span
											{uid}
											/?format=pdf&templatename=Pre-Printed P.O.

											Which purchase bill types are supported?
									Node:

										Element:p
											Rendering purchase bills into pdf format can be processed for the

											Item, Service
											and
										Element:strong
											Professional
											layout types. The miscellaneous bill type does not have printing capabilities in AccountRight Live.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											Please note:
										Element:code
											/Purchase/Bill/
											is not supported because a template can only be uniquely identified using the purchase bill layout type.

										Element:p
											A template parameter
										Element:code
											templatename=
											can be passed to explicitly tell the API which custom form to render the bill with i.e.
										Element:code
											templatename=Pre-Printed P.O.
											. This is not mandatory to include as the purchase layout and printed form set on the supplier contact card will default instead.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If the supplier contact card does not contain a default purchase layout and printed form, the template will default to the standard AccountRight Live
										Element:strong
											Plain Paper P.O.
											for the layout type the purchase belongs to.

											Each purchase type has it's own specific set of templates and forms that are unique to it, therefore if you create a custom form template for a purchase layout type of item, you cannot use this to print or render a service or professional purchase, only item.

											Note:
											custom form template names are not case sensitive when passing through.
