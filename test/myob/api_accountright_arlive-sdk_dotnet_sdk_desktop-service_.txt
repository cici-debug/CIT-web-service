											If using the SDK to talk to the AccountRight API locally on the default base url
										Element:strong
											http://localhost:8080/accountright
											the best place to start here is fetching a list of company files available inside the
										Element:a
											AccountRight library
											on the desktop.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The following snippet of code includes the services and contracts required to do this (c# example), here we are initialising an instance of the
										Element:strong
											ApiConfiguration
											class along with a call to the
										Element:strong
											CompanyFileService
											which is used to initialise a service that can fetch company files in a synchronous fashion (SDK also supports making calls in an
										Element:a
											asynchronous
											fashion).

											Next step in the flow is to select a company file that supports v2 contracts for the AccountRight API - anything from 2013.3 and up will do here.

											var companyFile = companyFiles.FirstOrDefault(x => new Version(x.ProductVersion) >= new Version("2013.3"));

											The company file credentials are an AccountRight requirement with the SDK providing the
										Element:strong
											CompanyFileCredentials
											class to encapsulate these. For our example the company file login details in use are username: Administrator with no password on the admin account.

									(type) c
									(layer)3

											var credentials = new CompanyFileCredentials("Administrator","");
