						Node:

							Element:p
								This endpoint returns a list of all locations, including locations not marked as visible, updated since the specified time. Clients are expected to cache this data indefinitely. The response is paginated, and the “Link” header in the API response contains the URL for the next page of results. When a call returns a
							Element:code
								204 No Content
								response, the client knows that they have reached the current end of results.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This endpoint only returns full details on locations which are listed as “live” in the LevelUp ecosystem.
