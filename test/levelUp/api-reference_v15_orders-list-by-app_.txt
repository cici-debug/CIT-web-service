							Element:p
								This endpoint returns a list of orders placed by the current user through the requesting app. The response includes user-oriented data, as opposed to merchant-oriented data. If the app is considered “global”, this endpoint returns all orders placed at any merchant through the requesting app. To list orders by app for a user, you must have a user access token with the
							Element:code
								read_user_orders
								permission. The response is paginated, and the “Link” header in the API response contains the URL for the next page of results. When a call returns a
							Element:code
								204 No Content
								response, the client knows that they have reached the current end of results.
