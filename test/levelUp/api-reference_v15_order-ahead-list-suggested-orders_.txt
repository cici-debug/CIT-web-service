								List Suggested Orders
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This endpoint returns a list of the user’s past order ahead orders and any available recommendations. As a user builds up more history within the app, and as LevelUp improves its recommendation algorithms, the API will return suggested orders generated based on the user’s order history and what’s popular with other users. You can use this endpoint to get past/suggested orders for a given location, or just for the user which will include past/suggested orders across their entire order history. The response includes a full shopping cart, including items and selected options, so that the order can be repeated. The response already removes any orders that can no longer be re-ordered due to changes in the merchant’s menu. The response already de-duplicates past orders, so if the user orders the same thing many times, it will only show up with a single represented order below, though that frequency will be factored into the sequencing in which the past orders are listed. It will return a maximum of 25 suggestions.

									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Include the types query parameter to filter which order types are returned, as a comma-separated list. If you don’t include the types parameter, orders of all types are returned. Invalid types are ignored. Valid types are:
