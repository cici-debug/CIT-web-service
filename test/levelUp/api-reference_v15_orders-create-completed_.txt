											Spend Amount and Partial Authorization
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When creating an completed order request, the
										Element:code
											spend_amount
											param should include the entire amount the customer is attempting to tender to LevelUp, inclusive of all discounts and taxes. For example, if a customer’s check is $10 and the customer has a $2 LevelUp discount, the requested
										Element:code
											spend_amount
											would be 1000 ($10 in cents). If the customer has a $2 LevelUp discount and a $5 merchant coupon (non-LevelUp), the
										Element:code
											spend_amount
											requested would be 500 ($3 due after application of $5 merchant coupon + $2 LevelUp discount applied = $5 paid through LevelUp -> 500 cents =
										Element:code
											spend_amount
											).
									Node:

											If tax is included in the example:

											$10 Subtotal
										Element:li
											$1 Tax
										Element:li
											$11 Grand Total
									Node:

										Element:p
											(apply $5 LevelUp discount (forgives tax))
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											$10 Subtotal
										Element:li
											$5 LevelUp Discount
										Element:li
											$.5 Adjusted Tax
										Element:li
											$5.50 Amount Due
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											spend_amount
											sent to LevelUp for the above example would be 1050. This is equated by taking the amount (in cents) due (550) and adding the discount amount (500) for a total of 1050.
									Node:

										Element:p
											This endpoint allows for a
										Element:code
											partial_authorization_allowed
											flag. This flag will allow a user to transact for exactly the amount (in cents) of their available credit (in the case of gift card) or their preloaded account balance even if they request authorization for an amount greater than their available credit. If partial authorization is disabled (set to false or omitted), orders exceeding available balance will be rejected with an error. For example, if a user only has $5 in gift card credit (and no backup funding source) and attempts to pay for $10 worth of goods (requested
										Element:code
											spend_amount
											= 1000), the LevelUp API will respond with a 200 OK and a
										Element:code
											spend_amount
											of 500. The customer should then be prompted to settle the remainder with another tender type.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											partial_authorization_allowed
											flag also enables merchants to offer “2 touch loyalty” to their customers. Essentially customers are allowed to use LevelUp for loyalty only, and are not required to link a payment method. These customer’s order reqests will always receieve a 200 OK response but their approved
										Element:code
											spend_amount
											will always be 0.
