								Show a Menu Item Image
						Node:

								This endpoint redirects the client, using an HTTP 302 response and Location header, to a menu item image of the requested dimensions, if one exists.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Please note that menu item images only exist in a very small subset of menus. All merchants, and associated locations, will have an image, but very few menus have images for each item. A base URL for the request is included in the “Show Menu” endpoint’s response as item[image_url]. The client should add appropriate query parameters.
