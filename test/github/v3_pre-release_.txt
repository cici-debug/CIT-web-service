					Pre-release launches allow you to begin applying new features and functionality to your workflows before they're officially launched. As we polish the project, your feedback will ensure the implementation works for as many use cases as possible when the project moves to general release.

					Pre-releases are ready to be used to build real solutions that can be shared with your users in a pre-release setting, but they should not be used in full production situations. While we're confident in the direction of the project, there is a chance for announced breaking changes as we respond to feedback.
