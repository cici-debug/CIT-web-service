					Notifications are optimized for polling with the "Last-Modified" header. If there are no new notifications, you will see a "304 Not Modified" response, leaving your current rate limit untouched. There is an "X-Poll-Interval" header that specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll. In times of high server load, the time may increase. Please obey the header.
