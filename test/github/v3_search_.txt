											About the Search API
										Element:span
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The Search API is optimized to help you find the specific item you're looking for (e.g., a specific user, a specific file in a repository, etc.). Think of it the way you think of performing a search on Google. It's designed to help you find the one result you're looking for (or maybe the few results you're looking for). Just like searching on Google, you sometimes want to see a few pages of search results so that you can find the item that best meets your needs. To satisfy that need, the GitHub Search API provides
										Element:strong
											up to 1,000 results for each search
											.

											Ranking search results
										Element:span
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Unless another sort option is provided as a query parameter, results are sorted by best match, as indicated by the
										Element:code
											score
											field for each item returned. This is a computed value representing the relevance of an item relative to the other items in the result set. Multiple factors are combined to boost the most relevant item to the top of the result list.

									Node:

											The Search API has a custom rate limit. For requests using
										Element:a
											Basic Authentication
											,
										Element:a
											OAuth
											, or
										Element:a
											client ID and secret
											, you can make up to 30 requests per minute. For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit allows you to make up to 10 requests per minute.
									Node:
									(type) c

											Timeouts and incomplete results
										Element:span
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To keep the Search API fast for everyone, we limit how long any individual query can run. For queries that
										Element:a
											exceed the time limit
											, the API returns the matches that were already found prior to the timeout, and the response has the
										Element:code
											incomplete_results
											property set to
										Element:code
											true
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Reaching a timeout does not necessarily mean that search results are incomplete. More results might have been found, but also might not.

														Highlighting Repository Search Results
													Element:span
												Node:

													Element:p
														Some API consumers will want to highlight the matching search terms when displaying search results. The API offers additional metadata to support this use case. To get this metadata in your search results, specify the
													Element:code
														text-match
														media type in your Accept header. For example, via curl, the above query would look like this:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														curl -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.text-match+json' \ 'https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=tetris+language:assembly&sort=stars&order=desc'
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														This produces the same JSON payload as above, with an extra key called
													Element:code
														text_matches
														, an array of objects. These objects provide information such as the position of your search terms within the text, as well as the property that included the search term.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														When searching for repositories, you can get text match metadata for the

						Node:

								Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Only the
							Element:em
								default branch
								is considered. In most cases, this will be the

								master
								branch.
							Element:li
								Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.
							Element:li
								You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for
							Element:a
								is not valid, while
							Element:code
								language:go
							Element:a
								is.

												Node:

													Element:p
														Some API consumers will want to highlight the matching search terms when displaying search results. The API offers additional metadata to support this use case. To get this metadata in your search results, specify the
													Element:code
														text-match
														media type in your Accept header. For example, via curl, the above query would look like this:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														curl -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.text-match+json' \ https://api.github.com/search/code?q=addClass+in:file+language:js+repo:jquery/jquery
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														This produces the same JSON payload as above, with an extra key called
													Element:code
														text_matches
														, an array of objects. These objects provide information such as the position of your search terms within the text, as well as the property that included the search term.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														When searching for code, you can get text match metadata for the file
													Element:strong
														content
														and file
													Element:strong
														path
														fields. (See the section on
													Element:a
														text match metadata
														for full details.)
												Node:

														Some API consumers will want to highlight the matching search terms when displaying search results. The API offers additional metadata to support this use case. To get this metadata in your search results, specify the
