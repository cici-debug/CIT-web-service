					Deployments are a request for a specific ref (branch, SHA, tag) to be deployed. GitHub then dispatches deployment events that external services can listen for and act on. This enables developers and organizations to build loosely-coupled tooling around deployments, without having to worry about implementation details of delivering different types of applications (e.g., web, native).
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Deployment Statuses allow external services to mark deployments with a 'success', 'failure', 'error', or 'pending' state, which can then be consumed by any system listening for
				Element:code
					deployment_status
					events.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Deployment Statuses can also include an optional
				Element:code
					description
					and
				Element:code
					target_url
					, and we highly recommend providing them as they make deployment statuses much more useful. The
				Element:code
					target_url
					would be the full URL to the deployment output, and the
				Element:code
					description
					would be the high level summary of what happened with the deployment.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Deployments and Deployment Statuses both have associated
				Element:a
					repository events
					when they're created. This allows webhooks and 3rd party integrations to respond to deployment requests as well as update the status of a deployment as progress is made.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Below is a simple sequence diagram for how these interactions would work.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					+---------+ +--------+ +-----------+ +-------------+ | Tooling | | GitHub | | 3rd Party | | Your Server | +---------+ +--------+ +-----------+ +-------------+ | | | | | Create Deployment | | | |--------------------->| | | | | | | | Deployment Created | | | |<---------------------| | | | | | | | | Deployment Event | | | |---------------------->| | | | | SSH+Deploys | | | |-------------------->| | | | | | | Deployment Status | | | |<----------------------| | | | | | | | | Deploy Completed | | | |<--------------------| | | | | | | Deployment Status | | | |<----------------------| | | | | |
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Keep in mind that GitHub is never actually accessing your servers. It's up to your 3rd party integration to interact with deployment events. This allows for
				Element:a
					GitHub integrations
					as well as running your own systems depending on your use case. Multiple systems can listen for deployment events, and it's up to each of those systems to decide whether or not they're responsible for pushing the code out to your servers, building native code, etc.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Note that the
				Element:code
					repo_deployment
				Element:a
					OAuth scope
					grants targeted access to Deployments and Deployment Statuses
				Element:strong
					without
					granting access to repository code, while the
				Element:code
					repo
					scope grants permission to code as well.

						Node:

							Element:p
								The

						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								environment
								parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have multiple environments for verifying their applications, like 'production', 'staging', and 'qa'. This allows for easy tracking of which environments had deployments requested. The default environment is 'production'.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								auto_merge
								parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If the ref
							Element:em
								is
								behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds, the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will return a failure response.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								By default,
							Element:a
								commit statuses
								for every submitted context must be in a 'success' state. The
							Element:code
								required_contexts
								parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be "success", or to specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								payload
								parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								task
								parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might be 'deploy:migrations' to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an application with debugging enabled.
