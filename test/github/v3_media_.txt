					Custom media types are used in the API to let consumers choose the format of the data they wish to receive. This is done by adding one or more of the following types to the
				Element:code
					Accept
					header when you make a request. Media types are specific to resources, allowing them to change independently and support formats that other resources don't.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					All GitHub media types look like this:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					application/vnd.github[.version].param[+json]
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The most basic media types the API supports are:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					application/json application/vnd.github+json
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Neither of these specify a
				Element:a
					version
					, so you will always get the current default JSON representation of resources.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
				Element:strong
					Important
					: The default version of the API may change in the future. If you're building an application and care about the stability of the API, be sure to request a specific version in the
				Element:code
					Accept
					header as shown in the examples below.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					You can specify a version like so:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					application/vnd.github.v3+json
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					If you're specifying a property (such as full/raw/etc defined below), put the version before the property:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					application/vnd.github.v3.raw+json
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					You can check the current version through every response's headers. Look for the
				Element:code
					X-GitHub-Media-Type
					header:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:span
					curl https://api.github.com/users/technoweenie -I
				Element:span
					HTTP/1.1 200 OK
				Element:span
					X-GitHub-Media-Type: github.v3
				Element:span
					curl https://api.github.com/users/technoweenie -I \
				Element:span
					-H "Accept: application/vnd.github.full+json"
				Element:span
					HTTP/1.1 200 OK
				Element:span

				Element:span
					curl https://api.github.com/users/technoweenie -I \
				Element:span
					-H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.full+json"
				Element:span
					HTTP/1.1 200 OK
