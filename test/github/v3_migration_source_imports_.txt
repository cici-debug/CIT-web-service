					The source import APIs are currently in public preview. During this period, the APIs may change in a backwards-incompatible way. To access the API during the preview period, you must provide a custom

					The Source Import API lets you start an import from a Git, Subversion, Mercurial, or Team Foundation Server source repository. This is the same functionality as
				Element:a

					A typical source import would
				Element:a
					start the import
					and then (optionally)
				Element:a
					update the authors
					and/or
				Element:a
					set the preference
					for using Git LFS if large files exist in the import. A more detailed example can be seen in this diagram:

										Element:ul
										Element:li
										Element:code
											detecting
											- the "detection" step of the import is in progress because the request did not include a

											vcs
											parameter. The import is identifying the type of source control present at the URL.
										Element:li
										Element:code
											importing
											- the "raw" step of the import is in progress. This is where commit data is fetched from the original repository. The import progress response will include
										Element:code
											commit_count
											(the total number of raw commits that will be imported) and
										Element:code
											percent
											(0 - 100, the current progress through the import).
										Element:li
										Element:code
											mapping
											- the "rewrite" step of the import is in progress. This is where SVN branches are converted to Git branches, and where author updates are applied. The import progress response does not include progress information.
										Element:li
										Element:code
											pushing
											- the "push" step of the import is in progress. This is where the importer updates the repository on GitHub. The import progress response will include
										Element:code
											push_percent
											, which is the percent value reported by
										Element:code
											git push
											when it is "Writing objects".
										Element:li
										Element:code

										Element:li

										Element:li
										Element:code
											detection_found_nothing
											- the importer didn't recognize any source control at the URL. To resolve,

										Element:li
										Element:code
