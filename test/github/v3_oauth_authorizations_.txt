								You can use this API to list the set of OAuth applications that have been granted access to your account. Unlike the
							Element:a
								list your authorizations
								API, this API does not manage individual tokens. This API will return one entry for each OAuth application that has been granted access to your account, regardless of the number of tokens an application has generated for your user. The list of OAuth applications returned matches what is shown on
							Element:a
								the application authorizations settings screen within GitHub
								. The
							Element:code
								scopes
								returned are the union of scopes authorized for the application. For example, if an application has one token with
							Element:code
								repo
								scope and another token with
							Element:code
								user
								scope, the grant will return
							Element:code
								["repo", "user"]
								.
