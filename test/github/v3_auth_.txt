					While the API provides multiple methods for authentication, we strongly recommend using
				Element:a
					OAuth
					for production applications. The other methods provided are intended to be used for scripts or testing (i.e., cases where full OAuth would be overkill). Third party applications that rely on GitHub for authentication should not ask for or collect GitHub credentials. Instead, they should use the
				Element:a
					OAuth web flow
					.

						Node:

							Element:p
								The API supports Basic Authentication as defined in
							Element:a
								RFC2617
								with a few slight differences. The main difference is that the RFC requires unauthenticated requests to be answered with
							Element:code
								401 Unauthorized
								responses. In many places, this would disclose the existence of user data. Instead, the GitHub API responds with
							Element:code
								404 Not Found
								. This may cause problems for HTTP libraries that assume a
							Element:code
								401 Unauthorized
								response. The solution is to manually craft the
							Element:code
								Authorization
								header.

											For example, if you're accessing the API via

							Element:span
						Node:

							Element:p
								For users with two-factor authentication enabled, Basic Authentication requires an extra step. When you attempt to authenticate with Basic Authentication, the server will respond with a
							Element:code
								401
								and an
							Element:code
								X-GitHub-OTP: required; :2fa-type
								header. This indicates that a two-factor authentication code is needed (in addition to the username and password). The
							Element:code
								:2fa-type
								in this header indicates whether the account receives its two-factor authentication codes via SMS or via an application.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In addition to the Basic Authentication credentials, you must send the user's authentication code (i.e., one-time password) in the
							Element:code
								X-GitHub-OTP
								header. Because these authentication codes expire quickly, we recommend using the Authorizations API to
							Element:a
								create an access token
								and using that token to
							Element:a
								authenticate via OAuth
								for most API access.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Alternately, you can create access tokens from the Personal Access Token
							Element:a
								settings page
								.
