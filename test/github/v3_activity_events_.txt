					Events are optimized for polling with the "ETag" header. If no new events have been triggered, you will see a "304 Not Modified" response, and your current rate limit will be untouched. There is also an "X-Poll-Interval" header that specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll. In times of high server load, the time may increase. Please obey the header.
