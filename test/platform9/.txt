					Platform9 is the simplest way for enterprises to implement a private cloud, with intelligent, self-service provisioning of workloads onto their computing infrastructure. Platform9’s cloud service enables the use of existing and new virtualized servers to power private clouds in a minutes, while interoperating seamlessly with existing processes and management products.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Platform9 is based on OpenStack and is 100% compatible with core OpenStack APIs. This documentation describes Platform9’s REST APIs, which include APIs for core OpenStack components that Platform9 supports such as Nova, Glance and Keystone, along with APIs for Platform9’s proprietary components such as Resource Manager.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
				Element:aside
					To use Platform9’s REST API, you are
				Element:strong
					required
					to get an authentication token, which must be passed into all API calls as an
				Element:code
					X-Auth-Token
					request header. All REST API calls are in JSON format. Check the
				Element:a
					Usage
					section for more information.

								Service Endpoint
								: A Service Endpoint is a distinct web service exposed by Platform9. For eg, Nova, Glance, Keystone and Resource Manager are the distinct Service Endpoints. Each Service Endpoint has a distinct URL that follows the format:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:code
								https://<my-company-platform9-url>/<service-endpoint-name>
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								Example: ‘https://foo.platform9.net/keystone’
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								where:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								◦
							Element:strong
								my-company-platform9-url
								is the URL corresponding to the Platform9 account created for your company. This URL is typically of the format https://{company-name}.platform9.net. Eg https://foo.platform9.net
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								◦
							Element:strong
								service-endpoint-name
								is the distinct name for the given service endpoint. For eg the service-endpoint-name for Keystone Service Endpoint is ‘keystone’. The corresponding documentation sections for each Service Endpoint such as Nova, Glance, Keystone and Resource Manager will list the distinct Service Endpoint URL at the beginning.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A REST API request to a Service Endpoint always includes the version of the API being referenced, immediately after the Service Endpoint name.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Example: ‘https://foo.platform9.net/keystone/v2.0’
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2

								where ‘2.0’ is the current supported version of keystone API.

								Tenant
								: Platform9 Private Cloud is designed to be shared by multiple users and teams of users. The concept of a ‘Tenant’ is designed so that Administrators can create a distinct Tenant per team of users that will be using the Platform9 Private Cloud. For eg, an Administrator might want to create distinct Tenants for ‘Development’ and ‘QA’ teams to definte different logical pools of resources that each of these teams will utilize. At any given point, a user logged into Platform9 is always operating in the context of a distinct Tenant. An Administrator can assign a given user to one or more Tenants.
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Role
								: Role-based access controls what functionality a user has access to, within a given Tenant. Platform9 currently supports two roles.
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Administrator
								: As an Administrator user, you have complete access to all functionality exposed by Platform9. You can add or remove servers to Platform9, configure networking, populate image catalog, create and destroy instances etc.
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Self-Service User
								: A Self-Service user does not have access to infrastructure. He cannot see or manipulate servers, storage or networking configuration. But he does have access to all instances running within a given tenant, as well as Images in the catalog that the tenant has access to. He can create a new instance from Images in the catalog, view all instances running within given tenant, perform lifecycle operations on them, or delete them.
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Flavor
								: A flavor is a pre-defined instance configuration that determines the amount of CPU, Memory and Storage that will be allocated to an instance. Flavors allow the Administrators to standardize on one or more resource configurations for instances within their environment and ensure that all instances are created using one of these standard configurations only. Platform9 ships with a default set of useful flavors, but Administrators can create their own set of flavors that better suit their environments.

								A typical Platform9 REST API call involves following two steps:

								All Platform9 REST API calls use JSON as content type. Set the content-type property to be “application/json” in the request header for all Platform9 REST API calls.

								Get an authorization token from keystone by making a POST request to:

							Element:p
							Element:code
								https://<my-company-platform9-url>/keystone/v2.0/tokens
						Node:

								documentation
								for this endpoint to see the request format.)
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:aside
								NOTE: The authentication tokens generated by Platform9 Keystone are valid for 24 hours today. Once the token expires, the corresponding request will return a 401 Unauthorized response code. At this point, you must regenerate a new authentication token and pass it to the API calls.
							Element:br
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Make your REST API call by setting the ‘X-AuthToken’ parameter in request header to the authentication token you just received in the step above. Each REST API call URL will follow the syntax:
						Node:

						(layer)2
