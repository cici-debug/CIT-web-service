					**Line messaging API** connects your CRM software, website or an application to the Line's messaging platform. It enables direct communication with your customers on Line using the same platform that they already use when talking to their friends. It allows you to personally interact with them, keep them engaged with your business, and drive them to perform actions. The messages can be personal, informative, transactional, or promotional, and support text, images, buttons, and links. Line API can be used with both Line@ account and Line Official account. For opening a LINE Official account you need to submit a [partnership proposal](https://partner.line.me/en/partner/join) to LINE. For opening LINE@ account follow the instructions below.
