					When you're having an SMS campaign, it can be very useful to track it's performance and to measure your users conversion rates. For example, if you are sending One-Time PINs over an SMS, it is really important to track conversion rates so you can optimize your flow and processes. **SMS tracking solution** will automatically track every message sent over Infobip platform. Just set the **`track`** parameter to **`SMS`** , and optionally put the **`type`** parameter of your campaign and SMS tracking will be done automatically. These features are set in the **`tracking`** objects in the **[Fully featured textual message](doc:fully-featured-textual-message)** API method: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "POST /sms/1/text/advanced HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.infobip.com\nAuthorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n \"messages\":[\n {\n \"from\":\"InfoSMS\",\n \"destinations\":[\n {\n \"to\":\"41793026731\"\n }\n ],\n \"text\":\"Your PIN is 1a2B3c.\"\n }\n ],\n \"tracking\":{\n \"track\":\"SMS\",\n \t\t \"type\":\"One_Time_Pin\"\n }\n}", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] As a response you should receive a **`200 OK`** status with message details in the response body: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n \"bulkId\": \"1446634544520356423\",\n \"messages\": [\n {\n \"to\": \"41793026731\",\n \"status\": {\n \"groupId\": 1,\n \"groupName\": \"PENDING\",\n \"id\": 7,\n \"name\": \"PENDING_ENROUTE\",\n \"description\": \"Message sent to next instance\"\n },\n \"smsCount\": 1,\n \"messageId\": \"8ef699bc-d4c6-4cf6-8d6e-9a9aa62ad93a\"\n }\n ]\n}", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "Conversion rate submision" } [/block] When user successfully performs the action after receiving the SMS, for example enters One-Time PIN in your app, you can send that info to us so we can measure **Conversion rates**. For Conversion rate submission, you need to provide only the `messageId` received after sending the SMS message. The `messageId` has to be submitted to our endpoint as conversion happens. Endpoint for submitting the conversion rates: **`https://api.infobip.com/ct/1/log/end/{messageId}`**. **Example:** [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "POST /ct/1/log/end/8ef699bc-d4c6-4cf6-8d6e-9a9aa62ad93a HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.infobip.com\nAuthorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nContent-Type: application/json", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] As a response, you will receive a **`processKey`** that is used for [getting conversion rates and statistics](doc:getting-conversion-rate-and-statistics): [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "{\n \t\t\"processKey\": \"A37D448C1ACCA02FABA745522558326C\" \n} ", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] ----- ### **Tip:** [Get your Conversion rates and statistics](doc:getting-conversion-rate-and-statistics) You can easily get Conversion rates for your SMS tracking processes.
