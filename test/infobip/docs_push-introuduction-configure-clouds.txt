					To be able to start sending push notifications over Infobip IP Communication Platform you need to configure your applications by adding our PUSH libraries. The following links provide You with detailed technical documentation how to configure and build your mobile applications using Infobip libraries. ### [Android Mobile Messaging Quick Start](https://github.com/infobip/mobile-messaging-sdk-android/blob/master/README.md) ### [iOS Mobile Messaging Quick Start ](https://github.com/infobip/mobile-messaging-sdk-ios/blob/master/README.md) Once the application has been successfully built You can continue with finalizing the Cloud Platforms configurations in the [Customer Portal](https://portal.infobip.com/push/applications). [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) Setup" } [/block] To enable push notifications for iOS just mark the checkbox **`Available on iOS`** and insert the certificate you issued during the configuration described in the [APNS Certificate Setup Guide](doc:apns-setup). For you convenience we introduced **SANDBOX** which you can turn on and off just in one click. **SANDBOX** option automatically redirects request to Developer APNS environment, if **SANDBOX** is not active we send all request to production environment. [block:callout] { "type": "warning", "body": "Cloud registration tokens issued by APNS Production environment aren't valid in APNS **SANDBOX** environment.", "title": "Warning:" } [/block] [block:image] { "images": [ { "image": [ "https://files.readme.io/qunabLA3TYeNgKgHMUdt_IOS_setup.png", "IOS_setup.png", "742", "178", "#56738a", "" ], "sizing": "smart" } ] } [/block] On click to the certificated field you will receive dialogue for selecting APNS certificate for upload. **Supported formats .p12**. If you created certificate without password, just let password field empty. Click **`Save`** button to apply the certificate. Our platform automatically checks the certification validity and in case of an error will send an alert right in the interface. [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) Setup" } [/block] To enable push notifications for GCM just mark the checkbox and insert GCM Server Key you issued in [GCM Server API-Key Setup Guide](doc:gcm-setup). Click **`Save`** button to apply GCM Server Key. Our platform automatically checks the GCM Server Key validity and in case of an error will send an alert right in the interface. [block:image] { "images": [ { "image": [ "https://files.readme.io/N9PJl0hISSqdp7vj2Y10_android_app_setup.png", "android_app_setup.png", "733", "142", "#597385", "" ], "sizing": "smart" } ] } [/block] ------ Once You've configured your app lets send Your first PUSH message. [block:callout] { "type": "warning", "body": "The PUSH messages can be sent both using our [Customer Portal](https://portal.infobip.com/push/applications) or using [API methods](/docs/send-push-notifications).", "title": "Info:" } [/block] ### **Next:** [Send PUSH message](/docs/send-push-notifications)
