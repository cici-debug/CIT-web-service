					You have opened a wine shop, and performed all necessary preparations for the grand opening. One of the most important things you'll need to do is to invite your future customers. Do it over SMS - one of the most powerful promotional channels. We will help you do it! For sending the same message to multiple phone numbers, you need to perform a HTTP POST request to `https://api.infobip.com/sms/1/text/single`. As an example, our request will contain only two phone numbers for easier understanding: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "POST /sms/1/text/single HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.infobip.com\nAuthorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nContent-Type: application/json \n\n{ \n \"from\":\"WineShop\",\n \"to\":[ \n \"41793026727\",\n \"41793026834\"\n ],\n \"text\":\"Wine shop grand opening at Monday 8pm. Don't forget glasses.\"\n}", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] **Header** section of the request should contain *authorization* and *content type*: - Authorization: `Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==` - Content-Type: `application/json` Looking at the request body, there are three parameters: - `from` parameter represents the sender of the SMS message - it can be alphanumeric or numeric. *Alphanumeric* sender ID length should be between 3 and 11 characters (Example: `CompanyName`). Numeric sender ID length should be between 3 and 16 characters. - `to` parameter is an array of message destination addresses. Destination addresses must be in international format (Example: `41793026727`). - `text` text of the message that will be sent. This will send an SMS to two addresses with same content and sender. Response you will get will look like this: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{ \n \"bulkId\":\"f5c4322c-10e7-a41e-5528-34fa0b032134\",\n \"messages\":[ \n { \n \"to\":\"41793026727\",\n \"status\":{ \n \"id\":0,\n \"groupId\":0,\n \"groupName\":\"ACCEPTED\",\n \"name\":\"MESSAGE_ACCEPTED\",\n \"description\":\"Message accepted\"\n },\n \"smsCount\":1,\n \"messageId\":\"4a54f0242f19-b832-1c39-a7e7a2095f351ed2\"\n },\n { \n \"to\":\"41793026834\",\n \"status\":{ \n \"id\":0,\n \"groupId\":0,\n \"groupName\":\"ACCEPTED\",\n \"name\":\"MESSAGE_ACCEPTED\",\n \"description\":\"Message accepted\"\n },\n \"smsCount\":1,\n \"messageId\":\"9404a69cef19-7a31-ba39-92ace76a5f351ed2\"\n }\n ]\n}", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] In the response, you'll receive a `bulkId` and an array of `messages`: - `bulkId` is used for [getting delivery reports](doc:delivery-reports) for SMS messages sent to multiple destinations. - Array of `messages` consists of Send SMS response details: - `to` parameter as a message recipient - `status` [object](doc:response-codes) for message status - `smsCount` represent the number of SMS messages sent to one destination - `messageId` that uniquely identifies the message sent After you have sent out invitation messages, it's time to promote a different product to different customers. With a single API method multiple messages can be sent to a multiple destinations. ------- #### **Tip:** [Promote different products to different customers](doc:multiple-sms-to-multiple-destinations).
