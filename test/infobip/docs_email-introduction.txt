					Email nowadays plays an essential part in everyone’s daily business communication, and it is important to have it included in your business applications as well, either as a standalone service, or as part of our OMNI solution . In this brief introduction, we will provide instructions on how to set up everything that will enable you to send emails over our platform in no time. Our email service will allow you to create campaigns, send HTML emails, add attachments and view delivery reports to reach an ever increasing number of your clients directly, either through our portal, or the API, as explained in the next steps. [block:api-header] { "title": "Open an account" } [/block] [block:callout] { "type": "info", "title": "Note", "body": "If you are already using any of our other services you can skip this step." } [/block] To gain access to the Email API and it's features, you will need a valid Infobip account. By visiting [Get started page](https://www.infobip.com/en/get-started), you will be able to create an account in a few easy steps. [block:api-header] { "title": "Choose your domain carefully" } [/block] The most important step in this initial stage is choosing the way you would like to route your emails. Individuals and organizations often use email as their primary means of communication. However, most users recently have started complaining about their inboxes being flooded with unsolicited bulk emails or spam emails. No technique is a complete solution to the spam problem, and each has trade-offs between incorrectly rejecting legitimate email (false positives) and not rejecting all spam (false negatives). This is why the domain reputation rating system was introduced - recognizing potential threats for emails sent out from the domain, based on what was sent from it in the past. Since the domain reputation is affected by the type of emails being sent from it, once the domain is classified as 'bad' (possibly due to a generally negative impact from sending bulk type emails) - it is very hard to restore its reputation fully. It may be a good idea to separate the domains based on the type of messages that you are planning to send. For example: use different domains/subdomains for each type of email that you are intending to send (transactional, corporate, marketing, etc.) to keep the reputation levels separate. [block:api-header] { "title": "Register your domain with us" } [/block] For this step, you need to have access to your domain’s DNS configuration. Please, reach out to your account manager with your preferred domain so we can integrate it within our platform. You will receive additional instructions (DNS configuration) on how to establish a proper communication channel between your domain and our platform. Once the configuration is properly applied, you can follow the steps outlined in the following pages to successfully send emails. Alternatively, use our test domain as a start so you will be able to test our service without any prior commitment. Don’t worry, you will be able to switch to using your own domain at a later stage. If you have any questions regarding the service integration, please contact our support. ------ ### **Next:** [Send simple email](doc:simple-email)
