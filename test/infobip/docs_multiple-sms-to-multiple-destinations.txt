					Imagine you want to target your customers by offering them their favourite product during your next promotion. Every customer is specific and you shouldn't send the same message to all of them. Tailor your SMS messages by customers' preferences and get their full attention. You can use our multiple textual messages for that purpose. This option gives you the ability to send multiple messages to multiple destinations by calling one API method only once. Your request should be like this: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "POST /sms/1/text/multi HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.infobip.com\nAuthorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{ \n \"messages\":[ \n { \n \"from\":\"WineShop\",\n \"to\":\"41793026727\",\n \"text\":\"Hey Mike, delicious Istrian Malvazija is finally here. Feel free to visit us and try it for free!\"\n },\n { \n \"from\":\"WineShop\",\n \"to\":\"41793026834\",\n \"text\":\"Hi Jenny, we have new French Merlot on our shelves. Drop by our store for a free degustation!\"\n }\n ]\n}", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] This way you'll send specific SMS messages to multiple destinations in a single request. The response you get will contain information about all the messages sent out: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{ \n \"bulkId\":\"f5c4322c-10e7-a41e-5528-34fa0b032134\",\n \"messages\":[ \n { \n \"to\":\"41793026727\",\n \"status\":{ \n \"id\":0,\n \"groupId\":0,\n \"groupName\":\"ACCEPTED\",\n \"name\":\"MESSAGE_ACCEPTED\",\n \"description\":\"Message accepted\"\n },\n \"smsCount\":1,\n \"messageId\":\"4a54f0242f19-b832-1c39-a7e7a2095f351ed2\"\n },\n { \n \"to\":\"41793026834\",\n \"status\":{ \n \"id\":0,\n \"groupId\":0,\n \"groupName\":\"ACCEPTED\",\n \"name\":\"MESSAGE_ACCEPTED\",\n \"description\":\"Message accepted\"\n },\n \"smsCount\":1,\n \"messageId\":\"9404a69cef19-7a31-ba39-92ace76a5f351ed2\"\n }\n ]\n}", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] After you have sent these messages, you are able to get detailed stats and analyse them. For example, you can measure how many customers received an SMS invitation by getting delivery reports: - To get message Delivery Report [check these instructions](doc:delivery-reports). - For more details about Errors and Statuses [check this document](doc:response-codes). ----------- #### **Tip:** Check how many of your customers actually [got the message](doc:sms-delivery-reports).
