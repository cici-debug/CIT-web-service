					After the "Send SMS" HTTP request was submitted to the Infobip SMS API, you will get a response containing some useful information. If everything went well, it should provide a **`200 OK`** response with message details in the response body. Here is an example of a request for sending a single SMS: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "POST /sms/1/text/single HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.infobip.com\nAuthorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nContent-Type: application/json\nAccept: application/json\n\n{ \n \"from\":\"InfoSMS\",\n \"to\":\"41793026727\",\n \"text\":\"My first Infobip SMS\"\n}", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] And the appropriate response is shown below: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{ \n \"messages\":[ \n { \n \"to\":\"41793026727\",\n \"status\":{ \n \"id\":0,\n \"groupId\":0,\n \"groupName\":\"ACCEPTED\",\n \"name\":\"MESSAGE_ACCEPTED\",\n \"description\":\"Message accepted\"\n },\n \"smsCount\":1,\n \"messageId\":\"2250be2d4219-3af1-78856-aabe-1362af1edfd2\"\n }\n ]\n}", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] - **messages** is an array of all SMS messages that were sent in the last request. In our case, it contains only one message - **to** is a phone number which you have sent the SMS message to - Each message successfully submitted to Infobip platform is uniquely identified with the **messageId**. Furthermore, the Message ID can be used for checking [Delivery status](doc:sms-delivery-reports) or [Sent messages logs](doc:message-logs) - **smsCount** is the number of parts the message was split into - **status** is the object that further describes the state of sent message. For a full list of available statuses, visit this [link](doc:response-codes) ---------- ### **Next:** [Getting delivery reports for sent SMS messages.](doc:sms-delivery-reports)
