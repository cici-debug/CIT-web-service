					Sending a long SMS is not that different than sending a standard SMS. Request is the same, and the only difference is that you submit text longer than 160 characters. Your response will contain `smsCount` field that will indicate how many parts your message was split into. Message will be charged by the number of its parts. The example below shows a long SMS request: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "POST /sms/1/text/single HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.infobip.com\nAuthorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{ \n \"from\":\"WineShop\",\n \"to\":\"41793026727\",\n \"text\":\"Wine has been produced for thousands of years, with the earliest wines being drunk c. 6000 BC in Georgia. It had reached the Balkans by c. 4500 BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient Greece and Rome.\"\n}", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] And the response: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{ \n \"messages\":[ \n { \n \"to\":\"41793026727\",\n \"result\":{ \n \t\"groupId\":0,\n \"groupName\":\"ACCEPTED\",\n \"id\":0, \n \"name\":\"MESSAGE_ACCEPTED\",\n \"description\":\"Message accepted\"\n },\n \"smsCount\":2,\n \"messageId\":\"7150122a4b19-caf1-7dd56-34be-65321ab6d9a2\"\n }\n ]\n}", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] As you can see, `smsCount` [is 2 because our SMS had more than 160 characters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service#Message_size). It will be segmented and charged as two messages, but the recipient will receive it as one long message. ----------- #### **Tip:** Don't miss to check how to send a [Unicode messages](doc:unicode-messages).
