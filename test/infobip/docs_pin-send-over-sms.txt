											Documentation
											## Response format On success, response header HTTP status code will be `200 OK`. On error, you will receive an [error response status code](doc:2fa-status-codes-and-error-details) in the header and the response body will contain an [error object](doc:2fa-status-codes-and-error-details). If you try to create an application when you do not have the userâ€™s authorization, you will receive an error `401` Unauthorized. One of the common messages is **429 Too Many Requests**. Most often the source of this message is a security feature put in place on application level.[ Application: Get](doc:application-get) method offers a quick overview of the current settings. Closer examination of the values should reveal the reasons behind the message. **InitiationAttempts **and **verificationIntervalLength **properties are the usual suspects. ### Response |Parameter|Type|Description| |-|-|-| |*to*|String|Phone number to which 2FA message was sent.| |*ncStatus*|String|Status of sent Number Lookup. <br>Number Lookup status can have one of the following values: `NC_DESTINATION_UNKNOWN`, `NC_DESTINATION_REACHABLE`, `NC_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE`, `NC_NOT_CONFIGURED`. <br>If you get `NC_NOT_CONFIGURED` status, you should contact your account manager for configuring it. <br>**SMS will not be sent only if Number Lookup status is `NC_NOT_REACHABLE`**.| |*smsStatus*|String|Sent SMS status.
