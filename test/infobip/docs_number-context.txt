					Number Lookup helps you keep your mobile numbers database up to date. Mobile subscribers often change numbers, go into roaming and change providers while retaining their original phone number. Knowing which mobile numbers are in use and available, or which network your client is currently using can greatly improve accuracy and cost effectiveness for many types of businesses. With Number Lookup, you can determine: - which numbers are currently active - is the mobile number in roaming - is the mobile number ported - the optimal route for messages and voice Various **Number Lookup packages** are available, so you can choose the one that best fits your business: - **Database Cleaning:** Designed for companies with vast number databases, our Database Cleaning package enables identifying unused and inactive numbers. - **Portability:** Developed to resolve number portability issues for various company types, this package enables real-time number portability lookups to optimize message and voice routing. It includes all the features of the Database Cleaning package. - **Roaming:** Primarily created to serve the financial client segment, the package provides roaming information for optimized routing, prevention of ATM frauds and much more. The following example shows how you can get Number Lookup information using our API: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "POST /number/1/query HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.infobip.com\nAuthorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=\nContent-Type: application/json\nAccept: application/json\n\n{ \n \"to\":[\"41793026727\"]\n}", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] The `to` parameter is a list of all the numbers you want to check. Here is your result: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{ \n \"results\":[ \n { \n \"to\":\"41793026727\",\n \"mccMnc\":\"22801\",\n \"imsi\":\"228012120181810\",\n \"originalNetwork\":{ \n \"networkPrefix\":\"79\",\n \"countryPrefix\":\"41\"\n },\n \"ported\":false,\n \"roaming\":false,\n \"status\":{ \n \"groupId\":3,\n \"groupName\":\"DELIVERED\",\n \"id\":5,\n \"name\":\"DELIVERED_TO_HANDSET\",\n \"description\":\"Message delivered to handset\"\n },\n \"error\":{ \n \"groupId\":0,\n \"groupName\":\"OK\",\n \"id\":0,\n \"name\":\"NO_ERROR\",\n \"description\":\"No Error\",\n \"permanent\":false\n }\n }\n ]\n}", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] [block:callout] { "type": "info", "title": "Information:", "body": "Depending on your package, some information may not be accessible. For a package change, contact your Account Manager." } [/block] ---------- For more information about this method and receiving a Number Lookup result on your Notify URL, visit the official documentation [page](doc:sending-synchronous-request).
