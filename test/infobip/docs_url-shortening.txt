					After developing an app your next step will be to promote it. One of the safest and most reliable ways to do that is with an SMS, but what to do if your URL is too long? **URL shortening and tracking solution** will not only automatically shorten your long links, it will also track your users’ click-through rates. Just put the original URL into the message body, set the **`track`** parameter and everything else will be done by Infobip platform. These features are set in the **`tracking`** objects in the **[Fully featured textual message](doc:fully-featured-textual-message)** API method: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "POST /sms/1/text/advanced HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.infobip.com\nAuthorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n \"messages\":[\n {\n \"from\":\"InfoSMS\",\n \"destinations\":[\n {\n \"to\":\"41793026727\"\n }\n ],\n \"text\":\"Hey, take a look at this awesome app. Can you beat my score: http://www.example.com/awesomeApp/someUserId\"\n }\n ],\n \"tracking\":{\n \"track\":\"URL\",\n \t\t \"type\":\"SOCIAL_INVITES\"\n }\n}", "language": "json" }, { "code": "POST /sms/1/text/advanced HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.infobip.com\nAuthorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n<request>\n <bulkId>BULK-ID-123-xyz</bulkId>\n <messages>\n <message>\n <from>InfoSMS</from>\n <destinations>\n <destination>\n <to>41793026727</to>\n <messageId>MESSAGE-ID-123-xyz</messageId>\n </destination>\n <destination>\n <to>41793026731</to>\n </destination>\n </destinations>\n <text>Hey, take a look at this awesome app. Can you beat my score: http://www.example.com/awesomeApp/someUserId</text>\n </message>\n </messages>\n\t<tracking>\n\t\t<track>URL</track>\n\t\t<type>SOCIAL_INVITES</type>\n\t</tracking>\n</request>", "language": "xml" } ] } [/block] The user will receive the original SMS message with the shortened URL: >*Hey, take a look at this awesome app. Can you beat my score: http://eel.nu/NJxE/cJ9UH* [block:callout] { "type": "warning", "title": "Important:", "body": "Each sent message gets a unique Infobip short URL and it will take **25 characters** out of your message." } [/block] As soon as the user clicks the link, we can automatically **send you a user's phone number** so you will instantly know when the conversion happens.
