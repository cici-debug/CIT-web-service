					Social invites are the most efficient app referral system: by including this capability, users can send an SMS to their phone contacts and invite them to download your app and try it out for themselves. The SMS is free for the user and You can include information about the contact who is sending it, which guarantees it will be read more carefully. [block:callout] { "type": "warning", "title": "Social Invites explained", "body": "1. Send SMS using API to increase interest of your app\n2. Infobip takes care about global coverage and highest delivery rates\n3. User receives SMS containing direct download link for you app\n4. User opens the SMS and clicks the link - You get a new client\n5. Analyze statistics to detect conversion rate patterns" } [/block] Furthermore, Infobip offers you the possibility to understand how many people recommended your app to their friends and how many of those friends viewed your app on the app store. It is done by automatic activation of conversion rate statistics for social invites messages sent to users. Integrating social invites into your app is as easy as all Infobip solutions. In the following tutorial we’ll show you how to do it in three easy steps. [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "Step 1. Send Social Invites" } [/block] The Social Invites functionality is a built-in feature of the **[Fully featured textual message](doc:fully-featured-textual-message)** API method. You just need to include the **`tracking`** object in the request. [block:callout] { "type": "info", "title": "Note", "body": "When defining the tracking object for Social Invites, set the parameter **`track`** to **`URL`**.\n\nFor parameter **`type`** choose your own identifier. For example : **`IOS_APP`**, or **`SOCIAL_INVITES`**" } [/block] By enabling **`tracking`** you are both enabling automatic shortening of your long links and also tracking users’ click-through rates. Here is an example how to send social invites for your new Android application using Infobip's API : [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "POST /sms/1/text/advanced HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.infobip.com\nAuthorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n \"bulkId\":\"BULK-ID-123-xyz\",\n \"messages\":[\n {\n \"from\":\"InfoSMS\",\n \"destinations\":[\n {\n \"to\":\"41793026727\",\n \"messageId\":\"MESSAGE-ID-123-xyz\"\n },\n {\n \"to\":\"41793026731\"\n }\n ],\n \"text\":\"Hey, take a look at this awesome application : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myApp\"\n }\n ],\n \"tracking\":{\n \"track\":\"URL\",\n \t\t \"type\":\"SOCIAL_INVITES\"\n }\n}", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] The user will receive the original SMS message with the shortened URL: >*Hey, take a look at this awesome application: http://eel.nu/EJsE/cf9ZH* So, the only remaining things are : open the SMS message and click the shortened link - and you have a new user on your application! In the following chapter we'll show You how to retrieve the conversion rate statistics for your new and awesome application. [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "Step 2. Social Invites Statistics" } [/block] In order for You to focus on Your new app Infobip will take care of the delivery of messages and will handle the conversion rate process statistics. [block:callout] { "type": "info", "title": "Social Invites conversion rate process", "body": "Send SMS - start process\nUser clicks link - end of process\n\nFully automatized feature - no need for additional API calls or additional parameters" } [/block] As soon as you've sent your message with included **`tracking`** object the conversion rate process has begun. Once the user clicks the link included in the SMS the end of process is triggered. It is all done automatically, with no need to configure additional parameters or call different APIs, all the messages and URL link clicks will be included in the statistics. [block:api-header] { "type": "get", "title": "api.infobip.com/ct/1/process" } [/block] The conversion rate processes are identified by a **`key`**. There are several methods which can be used to obtain the statistics of conversion rate processes but the first step is to get all conversion rate processes linked to your account. **JSON request** [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "GET: /ct/1/processes\nHTTP/1.1\nHost: api.infobip.com\nAuthorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nContent-Type: application/json", "language": "json", "name": "JSON" } ] } [/block] **JSON response** - contains all processes on a single account [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n\"processes\": [1]\n {\n \"key\": \"34BC1CA2CA7DF423459556AD7FC5A1A2\"\n \"name\": \"AUTO_GENERATED_PROCESS\"\n \"timeAdded\": \"2015-03-29T11:01:49.373+0000\"\n \"type\": \"SOCIAL_INVITES\"\n \"description\": \"Auto generated tracking process.\"\n\t}\n}", "language": "json", "name": "JSON" } ] } [/block] [block:api-header] { "type": "get", "title": "api.infobip.com/ct/1/process/:key/conversionrate" } [/block] Using the **`key`** from the previous statement retrieve conversion rate statistics for a single process. **JSON Request** [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "GET: /ct/1/process/34BC1CA2CA7DF423459556AD7FC5A1A2/conversionrate\nHTTP/1.1\nHost: api.infobip.com\nAuthorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nContent-Type: application/json", "language": "json", "name": "JSON" } ] } [/block] **JSON Response** - conversion tracking statistics [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n \"statistics\": [\n {\n \"intervalStart\": \"2015-02-12T09:58:20.337+0100\",\n \"startCount\": 200,\n \"endCount\": 170,\n \"conversionRate\": 0.85\n }\n ], \n \"cumulativeStatistics\": {\n \"startCount\": 200,\n \"endCount\": 170,\n \"conversionRate\": 0.85\n }\n}", "language": "json", "name": "JSON" } ] } [/block] The Response contains basic statistical data of a single conversion rate process : |Parameter|Type|Description| |-|-|-| |*startCount*|long|Number of sent SMS messages| |*endCount*|long|Number of opened links from SMS messages.| |*conversionRate*|double|Conversion rate for your application.| The following statistics represent the basic set of data which is collected and that could be retrieved using API. Additionally, we collect detailed CTR with other useful information: - User’s mobile phone number - Network prefix - Country prefix - Mobile phone operating system ***[Contact us](mailto:conversion.tracking@infobip.com)* for additional information about conversion tracking and setup assistance.**
