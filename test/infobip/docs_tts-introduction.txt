					# Service Description Voice messaging is an automated way to call many people to deliver a pre-recorder, or from text converted, voice message. Also known as VoiceSMS or Voice broadcast or robo calling it delivers voice messages to any fixed or mobile phone in the world. Text2Speech can also record calees voice or dial pad responses. Voice messaging helps many companies to save money, because it eliminated the need for call centers to spread messages. Many companies use Voice messaging to inform their customers of their latest promotions of offers. It is especially effective for spreading time sensitive messages like emergency messages, PINs for 2 Factor Authentication, last minute updates, to gen an opinion on certain matter, political messages and etc. # Developer API Our Voice messaging API is a simple REST API. For originating call you submit POST HTTP request with well-structured body and in response you get token by which you can identify originated call. With that token you can poll for call status, or call detailed record (CDR), which is an object containing detailed information about call. Our API provide several features, other than just playing voice message to end user. You can record entire call and get download URL of recorded file. You can tell us not to stop after just one failed try, and we will retry call, if necessary. You can instruct us to wait for user to enter one digit, and we will provide you with user input in CDR.
