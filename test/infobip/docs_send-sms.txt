					In a few simple steps, we will explain how to send an SMS using Infobip HTTP API. Firstly, you'll need a [valid Infobip account](http://www.infobip.com/en/get-started). Next, your username and password have to be encoded in `base64` like this: - Combine the username and password into a string `username:password`. - Encode the resulting string using Base64 encoder. [block:callout] { "type": "success", "title": "Example:", "body": "Username: `Aladdin`\nPassword: `openSesame`\n\nString: `Aladdin:openSesame`\nBase64 encoded string: `QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==`" } [/block] The message will be sent only to a valid phone number (numbers), written in **international format** e.g. `41793026727`. [block:callout] { "type": "info", "body": "We strongly recommend using the [E.164 number formatting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164). E.164 numbers are internationally standardized to a fifteen digit maximum length. Phone numbers are usually prefixed with *+* (plus sign), followed by a *country code*, *network code* and the *subscriber number*. Phone numbers that are not E.164 formatted may work, depending on the handset or network.", "title": "Phone numbers format" } [/block] Now, you are ready to create an HTTP POST request to `https://api.infobip.com/sms/1/text/single` Your **Header** should contain *authorization* and *content type*: - Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ== - Content-Type: application/json **Request body** contains the message you wish to send with `from`, `to` and `text` parameters. Full **JSON request** is shown below: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "POST /sms/1/text/single HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.infobip.com\nAuthorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nContent-Type: application/json\nAccept: application/json\n\n{ \n \"from\":\"InfoSMS\",\n \"to\":\"41793026727\",\n \"text\":\"My first Infobip SMS\"\n}", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] That's it! You should receive an SMS in a few moments. [block:callout] { "type": "warning", "body": "To protect end-users from receiving duplicated or repeated information over a short period of time, our platform has a flooding filter enabled by default with predefined thresholds counteracting possible programming and service errors. If your application has legitimate reasons, during a testing period for instance, for submitting a substantial amount of messages towards distinct subscribers, please get in touch with our support team at [support@infobip.com](mailto:support@infobip.com) to discuss a suitable solution.", "title": "Important:" } [/block] ---------- ### **Next:** [Handle Send SMS HTTP response](doc:send-sms-response) For more information about sending SMS messages using Infobip SMS API, plus a full list of available features, visit the [Documentation page](http://dev.infobip.com/v1/docs/send-single-sms).
