											Documentation
											# Response format On success, response header HTTP status code will be `200 OK` and the PIN code will be resent. On error, you will receive an [error response status code](doc:2fa-status-codes-and-error-details) in the header and the response body will contain an [error object](doc:2fa-status-codes-and-error-details). If you try to create an application when you do not have the userâ€™s authorization, you will receive an error `401` Unauthorized. ## Resend PIN response |Parameter|Type|Description| |-|-|-| |*to*|String|Phone number to which 2FA message was sent via voice.| |*pinId*|String|Sent PIN code ID.| |*callStatus*|String|Call status.| ### Call status list |Value|Description| |:---|:---| |`BAD_REQUEST`|Provided request does not meet required conditions.| |`PROCESSING`|Request is currently being processed.| |`PROCESSED`|Request is successfully processed and answered by human.| |`ANSWERED_MACHINE`|Request is successfully processed and answered by machine.| |`ERROR`|System error occurred during processing.| |`ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_CREDITS`|Not enough credits on account balance to pay for the call.| |`ERROR_NETWORK_NOT_AVAILABLE`|We could not find network for given destination address.| |`ERROR_ROUTE_NOT_AVAILABLE`|Route for TTS call is not set up on account.| |`ERROR_USER_BUSY`|User was busy during call attempt(s).| |`ERROR_NO_ANSWER`|User did not answer call(s).| |`UNDEFINED`|Request is undefined.|
