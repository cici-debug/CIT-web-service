					While using our API you may encounter certain **status **and **error **codes that you need to understand or troubleshoot. This page contains a list of all codes with thorough descriptions and action steps you need to take in case you are looking for a resolution of the problem. [block:callout] { "type": "warning", "body": "Use page **Search field** or **Find on page** web browser feature to quickly locate the code name you are looking for.", "title": "Find code name" } [/block] Code lists: * [HTTP status codes](#http-status-codes) * [API Status codes](#api-status-codes) * [General status codes](#section-general-status-codes) * [Voice status codes](#section-voice-status-codes) * [Push notification status codes](#section-push-notifications-status-codes) * [Error codes](#error-codes) * [General error codes](#section-general-error-codes) * [Voice error codes](#section-voice-error-codes) * [Push notification error codes](#section-push-notification-error-codes) * [Email error codes](#section-email-error-codes) * [Chat error codes](#section-chat-error-codes) [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "HTTP status codes" } [/block] Every HTTP transaction has a status code sent back by the server to define how the server handled the transaction. Most common statuses you may have encountered are `200 OK` and `404 Not Found` [Learn more about HTTP status codes here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "API Status codes" } [/block] Besides standard HTTP status code, status object may be returned as part of the API response message, delivery report or message log. Status object example: [block:code] { "codes": [ { "code": "{ \n \"groupId\":3,\n \"groupName\":\"DELIVERED\",\n \"id\":5,\n \"name\":\"DELIVERED_TO_HANDSET\",\n \"description\":\"Message delivered to handset\"\n}", "language": "json" } ] } [/block] ##General status codes ###PENDING (group id: 1) - general status codes Message has been processed and sent to the next instance i.e. mobile operator. |Id|Status| |-|-| |3|`PENDING_WAITING_DELIVERY`<ul><li>Message has been processed and sent to the next instance i.e. mobile operator with request acknowledgment from their platform.

Field `to` is used to query the message recipient segment. For example you can try to target by some "tag" which doesn't exist at any of instances of requested ApplicationCode, then it will return "no destinations" as we couldn't find in our database anyone which would satisfy requested conditions. In another example, you may want to target all application instances (devices) with Android OS. In this case you have to use CloudType: `GCM` and API internally will resolve all destinations and will send message to all android devices linked to requested ApplicationCode. You also can check you valid registrations by filtering in our [web interface](https://portal.infobip.com/subscribers/subscribers). More information about User Data you can find at our SDK pages: [iOS ](https://github.com/infobip/mobile-messaging-sdk-ios/wiki/User-data)and [Android](https://github.com/infobip/mobile-messaging-sdk-android/wiki/User-data)</li></ul>| ###REJECTED (group id: 5) - push notifications status codes Message has been received, but has either been rejected by Infobip, or the operator has reverted the rejected as final status. |Id|Status| |-|-| |65|`REJECTED_NO_APPLICATION `<ul><li>The status occurs when in Push API call is used invalid or not existent ApplicationCode in field `from`. Each application profile has it's own unique ApplicationCode. ApplicationCode is used in SDK as key identifier for Applicatoin installed on end user device being able to communicate with our platform. For the pair device + installed app pushRegistrationId is issued and it is uniquely linked to ApplicactionCode. It's possible to get all available applications [here](/docs/push-application-get). Or check configuration [here](/push/applications).</li></ul>| [block:api-header] { "type": "basic", "title": "Error codes" } [/block] Error object can be returned as part of the send message response or Delivery report response.
