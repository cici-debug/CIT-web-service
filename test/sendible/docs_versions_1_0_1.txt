					Hello Developers
				Element:span
			Node:

				Element:p
					The Sendible API can be used to build non-automated, authentic, high-quality apps and services that:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
					Help individuals share their content on social networks and blogs.
				Element:li
					Help brands understand their social media effectiveness.
				Element:li
					Help publishers curate and discover content.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					To get started,
				Element:a
					register as a developer
					. Once you've signed up, you will receive an email containing the following:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
					Your Sendible login details
				Element:li
					Your Application ID
				Element:li
					Your API Key
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Then,
				Element:a
					dive into the documentation
					and start building!

					Authentication
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The Sendible API uses a custom protocol similar to OAuth 2.0 for simple, but effective authentication and authorization. Please note that all requests to the API must be made over SSL (https:// not http://).
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:h3
				Element:a
					Do you need to authenticate?
				Element:span
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The Sendible API requires authentication for almost all requests. Authenticated requests require either an access_token or an api_key. These tokens are unique to a user and should be stored securely. Access tokens are short-lived and are set to expire.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:h3
				Element:a
					Basic Authentication
				Element:span
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					We support Basic Authentication using your Sendible username and API key or password. You can also include these parameters in the querystring as follows:
				Element:em
					username=[username]&api_key=[api_key]
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					If you are an existing Sendible customer or you're building an application for one of our users, you can locate the Sendible api_key within
				Element:em
					Settings > Preferences > System Settings > Access Keys
					.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					If you are not yet a user, you will receive your API key and application ID after registering as a developer.

					Receiving an access_token
				Element:span
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					In order to receive an
				Element:strong
					access_token
					, you must do the following:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
					Direct the user to our authorization url.
				Element:li
					The server will redirect the user in one of 3 ways that you choose:
				Element:ul
				Element:li
				Element:strong
					Server-side flow (recommended):
					We include the access_token as part of the querystring and send it back to your server.
				Element:br
				Element:li
				Element:strong
					Client-side flow:
					We include the access_token as a fragment (#) in the URL. This method is less secure, but allows applications without any server component to receive an access_token.
				Element:li
				Element:strong
					oAuth2 (Implicit) Authentication:
					We include the access_token as a fragment (#) in the URL. We will include the access_token as part of the redirect URL once a user has authenticated.

					Server-side (Explicit) Flow
				Element:span
			Node:

					Using the server-side flow is quite easy. Simply follow these steps:
			Node:

															Node:
															(type) c

																Element:h5
																Element:a
																	Step One: Direct your user to our authorization URL
																Element:span
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:p
																Element:a
																	https://api.sendible.com/api/v2/auth?application_id=APPLICATION_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&source=server
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:p
																	At this point, we present the user with a login screen to Sendible.

																Element:h5
																Element:a
																	Step Two: Receive the redirect from Sendible
																Element:span
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:p
																	Once a user logs in, we issue a redirect to your redirect_uri with the access_token parameter to use in step three. We will also pass you the username of the authenticated user.
			Node:
			(type) c

															Node:

																Element:h5
																Element:a
																	Step Three: Store the access_token
																Element:span
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:p
																	Your application will receive the access_token and username of the authenticated user as querystring parameters. These should be stored so that API requests can be made on behalf of the authenticated user.

															Node:
