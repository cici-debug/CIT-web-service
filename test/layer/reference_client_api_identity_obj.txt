											The following JSON represents a typical Identity. It is referred to throughout this document as

											Identity
											; also note that

											BasicIdentity
											is frequently used when the full

											Note

											All values that are put into the Identity object can be observed by all users of your system. Its probably fine to expose phone numbers and email addresses to coworkers, but not to contacts on a social network.

											Identity objects can be created in two ways:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											Creating a Layer Session with an Identity Token will create an Identity if one does not yet exist. The Identity Token can be used to define the following fields of your Identity:
										Element:ul
										Element:li
										Element:code
											user_id
										Element:li
										Element:code
											display_name
										Element:li
										Element:code
											avatar_url
										Element:li
										Element:code
											public_key
										Element:li
										Element:code
											first_name
										Element:li
										Element:code
											last_name
										Element:li
											Identities can be created, updated and deleted via the
										Element:a
											Server API
											; only the Server API can be used to set ALL fields of the Identity.

														The

													Element:a
														¶
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														An ID consists of a prefix of
													Element:q
														layer:///identities/
														followed by a UUID. This ID format is common across all of the Layer Platform.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														This ID is a required parameter for many requests. It could also be used for indexing an in-app cache. Within Layer APIs, the full ID is used as a parameter; however, only the UUID is used if the ID is being used within a URL.

												Node:

														Metadata allows custom data to be associated with a Conversation. For example, there is no
													Element:code
														title
														property in the Conversation Object. If your Conversations need a title to share between all participants and render as part of your view, you can add a
													Element:code
														title
														property to the metadata and share it that way.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														All values in metadata must be strings or objects. The following metadata is valid:

												(type) c
