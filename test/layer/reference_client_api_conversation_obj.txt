														The

													Element:a
														¶
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														An ID consists of a prefix of
													Element:q
														layer:///conversations/
														followed by a UUID. This ID format is common across all of the Layer Platform.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														This ID is a required parameter for many requests. It could also be used for indexing an in-app cache. Within Layer APIs, the full ID is used as a parameter; however, only the UUID is used if the ID is being used within a URL.

												Node:

													Element:p
														A Participant is a user who can send and receive messages within this Conversation, and is represented in the
													Element:code
														participants
														property as an
													Element:a
														BasicIdentity
														. The
													Element:code
														participants
														property is an array of up to 25

														The

													Element:a
														¶
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Metadata allows custom data to be associated with a Conversation. For example, there is no
													Element:code
														title
														property in the Conversation Object. If your Conversations need a title to share between all participants and render as part of your view, you can add a
													Element:code
														title
														property to the metadata and share it that way.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														All values in metadata must be strings or objects. The following metadata is valid:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														{
													Element:span
														"metadata"
