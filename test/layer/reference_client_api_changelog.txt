														Formerly, you’d get a
													Element:code
														503 Service Unavailable
														error response (with
													Element:code
														code
														of
													Element:code
														1
														in the Error object) not only when a dependent service was unavailable, but also when any unexpected exception occurred. We now distinguish those scenarios properly. Now you’ll get
													Element:code
														500 Internal Server Error
														(with
													Element:code
														code
														of
													Element:code
														100
														) if something unexpected happens. If you see a
													Element:code
														500
														, please report it to us immediately, particularly if it’s repeatable.
