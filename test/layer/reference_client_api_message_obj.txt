												Node:

														An ID consists of a prefix of

														layer:///messages/
														followed by a UUID. This ID format is common across all of the Layer Platform.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														This ID is a required parameter for many requests. It could also be used for indexing an in-app cache. Within Layer APIs, the full ID is used as a parameter; however, only the UUID is used if the ID is being used within a URL.

												Node:

												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Conversations contain an array of messages, ordered by their
													Element:code
														position
														properties. The
													Element:code
														position
														is specific to each individual user and their view of the Conversation, which means that sorting by
													Element:code

														could lead to a different order for different users.

												Node:

														Each Message object identifies the Conversation it is a part of, providing both an

														id
														and a
													Element:code
														url
														for accessing it. Under normal conditions, it should be obvious what Conversation a Message belongs to. However, when receiving a Message via a websocket, the
													Element:code

												Node:

												(layer)4
													Element:p
														A Message is known to be read if any client that is authenticated as this user has sent a
													Element:a
														read receipt
														. Until that is received,
													Element:code
														is_unread
														is equal to true, and can be taken as a hint to your UI on how to highlight this Message.
												Node:

														The sender of a Message is always assumed to have read the Message even if no read receipt was sent.
