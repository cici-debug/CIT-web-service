											Announcements are a way to send system-level messages to users. Announcements are global (they are not part of a single conversation). In fact, an Announcement is a special type of
										Element:a
											Message
											. However, it is different in the following ways:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											Announcements can only be received, not sent via the REST API or WebSockets. Use the Server API to send announcements
										Element:li
											The object will not have a
										Element:code
											conversation
											property
										Element:li
											The
										Element:code
											id
											will be of the format
										Element:q
											layer:///announcements/UUID
										Element:li
											The object does not show the recipient status for other recipients;
										Element:code
											recipient_status
											will only show the current user and their receipt status
