Calls are charged based on destination and in per-minute blocks. Billing starts when both destination answers the call.\n\n**Separate charges apply for connecting the first and second destination number.** For example, if you make a call request between Singapore (US$0.015/min\\*) and USA (US$0.014/min\\*), you would be billed a total of US$0.029/min* for the call. Please check the [Pricing Section](http://developer.hoiio.com/pricing) for detail charges or you may retrieve the rates with [voice/get_rate API](doc:call-rate).\n\n** Rate accurate as of 17 Jan 2012.*","excerpt":"","slug":"make-call","type":"endpoint","title":"Make Call"}
