											The message that you want to play after the call is answered. Max 1000 characters. **Languages and Gender** To change the language or gender, use the `<speech>` markup. E.g. `<speech language="zh-HK" gender="female">請稍等，我們正在處理您的訂單。</speech>` Default language is English and default gender is Female. For the list of supported language and gender, please refer to [Text-to-Speech](/docs/an-overview#text-to-speech) for more details. **Custom Recordings** If you would like to use your own voice recordings or voice messages recorded via the [Record](/docs/record) block, use the `<url>` markup to specify a file for us to use. We will download the file and use it as the voice message. E.g. `<url>http://example.com/myrecording.mp3</url>` Only HTTP and HTTPS URL are supported. Supported file formats are .mp3, .wav and .gsm (8000 Hz, mono channel). File size must be 10MB or less. **Note:** There might be a slight delay when downloading the file for the first time. To enable us to cache your file locally for subsequent calls, please include the "Last-Modified" HTTP header. Subsequent calls will not have the delay if we are able to cache your file. If you have updated your file, make sure your file hosting web server respond to our HTTP header "If-Modified-Since" in our request with a "304 Not Modified".
