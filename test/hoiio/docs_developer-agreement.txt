BY PRESSING \"AGREE\", YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, PRESS \"CANCEL\" AND YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO BECOME A HOIIO DEVELOPER.\n\nHoiio Developer Agreement\n\n1. Relationship with Hoiio.\n\nYou understand and agree that by becoming a Hoiio Developer, no legal partnership or agency relationship is created between you and Hoiio. Neither you nor Hoiio is a partner, an agent or has any authority to bind the other. You agree not to represent otherwise. You also certify that you are of the legal age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside and you represent that you are legally permitted to become a Hoiio Developer. This Agreement is void where prohibited by law and the right to become a Hoiio Developer is not granted in such jurisdictions.\n\n2. Grant of Rights to Use Services.\n\nSubject to your acceptance of and compliance with this Agreement and with the payment requirements for the Services, Hoiio hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, non-sublicenseable right and license, in and under our intellectual property rights, to access and use the Services, solely in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features provided by Hoiio that augment or enhance the current Services shall also constitute \"Services\" and shall be subjected to these terms and conditions.\n\nYou may write a software application or website (\"Application\") that interfaces with the Services. You acknowledge that we may change, deprecate or republish APIs for any Service or feature of a Service from time to time, and that it is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you make to our Service are compatible with then-current APIs for the Service. Hoiio will attempt to inform you of any changes with reasonable notice so you can adjust your Application, but we are under no obligation to do so. You and any Applications that you may build, distribute, or otherwise create may make network calls or requests to the Services, or may receive phone calls via the Service, at any time that the Services are available. You may use the Services to execute Applications owned or lawfully obtained by you. You are solely responsible for your Applications, including any data, text, images or content contained therein. You are personally responsible for all traffic originating from your Applications using your account credentials to the Services. As such, you should protect your authentication keys and security credentials. Actions taken using your credentials shall be deemed to be actions taken by you, with all consequences including service termination, civil and criminal penalties. You further agree to abide by all applicable local, state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations and that You will be solely responsible for all acts or omissions that occur under Your account or password, including the content of Your transmissions through the Service.\n\n3. Developer Benefits.\n\nAs a Hoiio Developer, you may have the opportunity to attend certain Hoiio developer conferences, technical talks, and other events (\"Hoiio Events\"). In addition, you may gain access to the Hoiio Developer Portal (\"Portal\") and documentations, code samples or materials displayed on the Hoiio Developer Website (\"Content\"). Hoiio may change, suspend or discontinue providing the Hoiio Events, Portal and Content to you at any time, and may impose limits on certain features and materials offered or restrict your access to parts or all of materials without notice or liability.\n\n4. Restrictions.\n\nYou agree not to exploit the Services, Hoiio Events, Portal or Content provided to you as a Hoiio Developer, in any unauthorized way, including but not limited to, by trespassing, burdening network capacity or using the Services, Portal or Content other than for authorized purposes. Copyright and other intellectual property laws protect the Portal and Content provided to you, and you agree to abide by and maintain all notices, license information, and restrictions contained therein.\n\nYou may not copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of any software or security components of the Services, Portal, or of the Content. Use of the Services, Portal or Content to violate, tamper with, or circumvent the security of any computer network, software, passwords, encryption codes, technological protection measures, or to otherwise engage in any kind of illegal activity, or to enable others to do so, is expressly prohibited. Hoiio retains ownership of all its rights in the Services, Hoiio Events, Portal and Content, and except as expressly set forth herein, no other rights or licenses are granted or to be implied under any Hoiio intellectual property.\n\n5. Emergency Services, Number Portability and Directory Service.\n\nYou acknowledge and understand that we do NOT currently allow you to access any 911 or similar emergency services (no traditional 911, E911, or similar access to emergency services). In additions, you also acknowledge and understand that we do NOT currently provide number portability and directory services unless we specify in the Services. The Services are not intended to replace any primary phone service, such as a traditional landline or mobile phone, which may be used to contact emergency services.\n\n6. Amendment\n\nHoiio reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify this Agreement, including any rules and policies at any time. You will be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications (including new terms, updates, revisions, supplements, modifications, and additional rules, policies, terms and conditions) (\"Additional Terms\") communicated to you by Hoiio. All Additional Terms are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by this reference and your continued use of the Service or Portal will indicate your acceptance of any Additional Terms.\n\n7. Communication\n\nHoiio may be sending communications to you from time to time. Such communications may be in the form of phone calls, SMS and/or emails and may include, but not be limited to, marketing materials, technical information, and updates and/or changes regarding your participation as a Hoiio Developer. By agreeing to this Agreement, you consent that Hoiio may provide you with such communications.\n\n8. Confidentiality.\n\nYou agree that any information disclosed by Hoiio to you in connection with Hoiio Events, Portal or Content, will be considered and referred to as \"Hoiio Confidential Information\". Notwithstanding the foregoing, Hoiio Confidential Information will not include: (i) information that is generally and legitimately available to the public through no fault or breach of yours, (ii) information that is generally made available to the public by Hoiio.\n\nUnless otherwise expressly agreed or permitted in writing by Hoiio, you agree not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Hoiio Confidential Information to anyone other than to other Hoiio Developers who are employees and contractors working for the same entity as you and then only to the extent that Hoiio does not otherwise prohibit such disclosure. You further agree to take reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of Hoiio Confidential Information.\n\n9.

Hoiio may suspend or terminate you as a Hoiio Developer at any time in Hoiio's sole discretion. If Hoiio terminates you as a Hoiio Developer, Hoiio reserves the right to deny your reapplication at any time in Hoiio's sole discretion.\n\nUpon our suspension of your use of any Services, in whole or in part, for any reason: (i) fees will continue to accrue for any Services that are still in use by you, notwithstanding the suspension; (ii) you remain liable for all fees, charges and any other obligations you have incurred through the date of suspension with respect to the Services; and (iii) all of your rights with respect to the Services shall be terminated during the period of the suspension.\n\nUpon termination of this Agreement for any reason: (i) you remain liable for all fees, charges and any other obligations you have incurred through the date of termination with respect to the Services; and (ii) all rights and licenses granted to you by Hoiio will cease immediately, and you agree to destroy any and all Hoiio Confidential Information that is in your possession or control.
