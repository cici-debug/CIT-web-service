SMS are charged based on destination and in per multipart SMS. Charges still apply if the SMS was block by the recipient's telco. Please check the [Pricing Section](http://developer.hoiio.com/pricing) for charges or you may retrieve the rate for each SMS with [sms/get_rate](doc:sms-rate) API.","excerpt":"","slug":"send-bulk-sms","type":"endpoint","title":"Send Bulk SMS"}

Hoiio API does not support destination to short code, toll free, premium or emergency numbers. #Response Parameters [block:parameters] { "data": { "0-0": "`status`", "0-1": "The result of your request. Refer to [Result Status](doc:send-bulk-sms#result-status) for details. \nNote that success status doesn't mean all the messages are sent.

Please contact Hoiio support for assistance.", "16-0": "", "16-1": "" }, "cols": 2, "rows": 16 } [/block] **Limitations** Some Mobile Carriers do not support SMS Delivery Reports (for instance, the majority of US Carriers). For these instances, the status of the SMS provided by our `sms/get_history` and `sms/query_status` APIs will show the sms status as "queued" for these messages. If your application is dependent on the confirmation of SMS delivery, we would advise that you test against numbers from each of the different Mobile Carriers that your customers would be using, to determine if all these Carriers support SMS Delivery Reports. Do note, that SMS Delivery Reports are still a best-effort service, and you should still handle for cases when the status is not updated. #Charges Charges apply for each of the SMS that is sent via this API. SMS are charged based on destination and in per multipart SMS. Charges still apply if the SMS was block by the recipient's telco. Please check the [Pricing Section](http://developer.hoiio.com/pricing) for charges or you may retrieve the rate for each SMS with [sms/get_rate](doc:sms-rate) API.
