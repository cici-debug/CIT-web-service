											Documentation
											The Conference API component of Hoiio API provides developers access to telephony services in more than 200 countries around the world. You will be able to initiate call conferences just by making an API request to our servers. This API will call a list of destination numbers and place them in a conference call. Hoiio will call the numbers sequentially and place them in the same call conference room. You can also make seperate additional API requests to add new participants to any existing conference room. Each conference room allows a maximum of 8 active participants. If you want to support inbound conference, refer to [IVR Transfer API](doc:transfer) whch can transfer an incoming call to a conference room. This way, your users can call a Hoiio number and be transferred to a conference room. #Response Parameters [block:parameters] { "data": { "0-0": "`status`", "0-1": "The result of your request.
