You could write code (PHP/Java/any programming language), do a [curl command](doc:quick-start-guide#using-curl) on your terminal, or simply access a URL with your web browser!\n\nWe will choose the simplest way - access a URL with your web browser.\n\nIf you have followed Step 2, you would have already copied the URL.\n\nIf you didn't, you could copy the following URL and replace MY_APP_ID, MY_ACCESS_TOKEN and MY_PHONE_NUMBER with yours. For your phone number, enter in [E.164](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format eg. +16501234567\n[block:code]\n{\n \"codes\": [\n {\n \"code\": \"https://secure.hoiio.com/open/ivr/start/dial?dest=MY_PHONE_NUMBER&access_token=MY_ACCESS_TOKEN&app_id=MY_APP_ID&msg=Hello.%20Thank%20you%20for%20using%20Hoiio.%20With%20Hoiio%20API%2C%20you%20can%20easily%20add%20voice%20and%20SMS%20into%20your%20applications.%20Have%20a%20nice%20day.%20Goodbye!\",\n \"language\": \"text\"\n }\n ]\n}\n[/block]\n\nOpen up your web browser, paste the URL, and hit enter! You should see the API response with a \"success\" status.\n\nYour phone should ring. Answer the call, and you will hear the a message over the phone call.\n\nCongrats! You have successfully made your first Hoiio API request!\n\n\n\n#Using Curl\n\nAn equivalent curl command on your terminal would look like this:\n[block:code]\n{\n \"codes\": [\n {\n \"code\": \"$ curl https://secure.hoiio.com/open/ivr/start/dial \\\\\\n -d \\\"app_id=MY_APP_ID\\\" \\\\\\n -d \\\"access_token=MY_ACCESS_TOKEN\\\" \\\\\\n -d \\\"dest=MY_PHONE_NUMBER\\\" \\\\\\n -d \\\"msg=Hello. Thank you for using Hoiio. With Hoiio API, you can easily add voice and SMS into your applications. Have a nice day. Goodbye.\\\"\",\n \"language\": \"text\"\n }\n ]\n}\n[/block]\n\n#What's next?\n\nFundamentally, Hoiio API is invoked via HTTP request, hence opening an URL on your browser works. So does [curl](doc:quick-start-guide#using-curl).\n\nHowever, you will most likely be triggering the API by writing some code in your favorite programming language. For that, we recommend that you use our [SDKs](doc:sdk#sdk).\n\nTake a look at our [sample codes](doc:examples#examples) too.","excerpt":"","slug":"quick-start-guide","type":"basic","title":"Quick Start Guide"}
