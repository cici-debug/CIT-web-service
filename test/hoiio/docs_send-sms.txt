For messages that are longer, Hoiio will split them into multipart SMS up to a maximum of 3 SMS. Most mobile phones will be able to automatically reassemble these multipart SMS and present to the recipient as a single message.\n\nMessage character limits and number of SMS required:\n[block:parameters]\n{\n \"data\": {\n \"h-1\": \"1 SMS required\",\n \"h-2\": \"2 SMS required\",\n \"h-3\": \"3 SMS required\",\n \"0-0\": \"**ASCII**\",\n \"0-1\": \"160 characters or less\",\n \"0-2\": \"306 characters or less\",\n \"0-3\": \"459 characters or less\",\n \"1-0\": \"**Unicode**\",\n \"1-1\": \"70 characters or less\",\n \"1-2\": \"134 characters or less\",\n \"1-3\": \"201 characters or less\",\n \"2-0\": \"\",\n \"2-1\": \"\",\n \"2-2\": \"\",\n \"2-3\": \"\"\n },\n \"cols\": 4,\n \"rows\": 2\n}\n[/block]\nThe following ASCII characters counts as 2 characters when determining message length:\n[block:parameters]\n{\n \"data\": {\n \"0-0\": \"\\\\n\",\n \"0-1\": \"Line feed\",\n \"1-0\": \"[\",\n \"1-1\": \"Left square bracket\",\n \"2-0\": \"]\",\n \"2-1\": \"Right square bracket\",\n \"3-0\": \"\\\\\",\n \"3-1\": \"Backslash\",\n \"4-0\": \"^\",\n \"4-1\": \"Circumflex accent\",\n \"5-0\": \"{\",\n \"5-1\": \"Left curly bracket\",\n \"6-0\": \"}\",\n \"6-1\": \"Right curly bracket\",\n \"7-0\": \"|\",\n \"7-1\": \"Vertical bar\",\n \"8-0\": \"â‚¬\",\n \"8-1\": \"Euro sign\",\n \"9-0\": \"\",\n \"9-1\": \"\"\n },\n \"cols\": 2,\n \"rows\": 9\n}\n[/block]\n\n#SMS Rebranding\n\nThis feature allows you to change your SMS sender name to your company name or any text that you want.\n\nSMS rebranding has been tested to work in:\n\n* Singapore\n\nFor other countries, we will still send your message with the rebranded sender name, but the telco may override it.

In these instances, the status of the SMS provided by our `sms/get_history` and `sms/query_status` APIs will show the sms status as \"queued\" for these messages.\n\nIf your application is dependent on the confirmation of SMS delivery, we would advise that you test against numbers from each of the different Mobile Carriers that your customers would be using, to determine if all these Carriers support SMS Delivery Reports.\n\nDo note, that SMS Delivery Reports are still a best-effort service, and you should still handle for cases where the status is not updated.\n\n#Charges\n\nCharges apply for SMS that are sent via this API. SMS are charged based on destination and in per multipart SMS. Charges still apply if the SMS was block by the recipient's telco. Please check the [Pricing Section](http://developer.hoiio.com/pricing) for charges or you may retrieve the rates with [sms/get_rate](doc:sms-rate) API.","excerpt":"","slug":"send-sms","type":"endpoint","title":"Send SMS"}

											Documentation
											This API allows you to send SMS to mobile numbers in over 200 countries (for the full list of supported destinations, please check the [Pricing Section](http://developer.hoiio.com/pricing)). Hoiio API does not support destination to short code, toll free, premium or emergency numbers. #Message Characters Limit Each SMS are limited to 160 ASCII characters or 70 unicode characters. For messages that are longer, Hoiio will split them into multipart SMS up to a maximum of 3 SMS. Most mobile phones will be able to automatically reassemble these multipart SMS and present to the recipient as a single message. Message character limits and number of SMS required: [block:parameters] { "data": { "h-1": "1 SMS required", "h-2": "2 SMS required", "h-3": "3 SMS required", "0-0": "**ASCII**", "0-1": "160 characters or less", "0-2": "306 characters or less", "0-3": "459 characters or less", "1-0": "**Unicode**", "1-1": "70 characters or less", "1-2": "134 characters or less", "1-3": "201 characters or less", "2-0": "", "2-1": "", "2-2": "", "2-3": "" }, "cols": 4, "rows": 2 } [/block] The following ASCII characters counts as 2 characters when determining message length: [block:parameters] { "data": { "0-0": "\\n", "0-1": "Line feed", "1-0": "[", "1-1": "Left square bracket", "2-0": "]", "2-1": "Right square bracket", "3-0": "\\", "3-1": "Backslash", "4-0": "^", "4-1": "Circumflex accent", "5-0": "{", "5-1": "Left curly bracket", "6-0": "}", "6-1": "Right curly bracket", "7-0": "|", "7-1": "Vertical bar", "8-0": "â‚¬", "8-1": "Euro sign", "9-0": "", "9-1": "" }, "cols": 2, "rows": 9 } [/block] #SMS Rebranding This feature allows you to change your SMS sender name to your company name or any text that you want. SMS rebranding has been tested to work in: * Singapore For other countries, we will still send your message with the rebranded sender name, but the telco may override it. You may test this quickly with your trial account after you log in to the developer portal. We do not support SMS rebranding to * China * Dijibouti * Indonesia * Malaysia * South Africa * Vietnam For messages to these destinations, we will append `Fr:<sender_name>\n` to the start of your message. Note that these additional characters count towards your total message length. For sending SMS to USA, we can only rebrand to your US Hoiio Number. If `sender_name` is not set to your US Hoiio Number, we will append `Fr:<sender_name>\n` to the start of your message.

By default, the sender number is your registered number." }, "cols": 2, "rows": 18 } [/block] **Limitations** Some Mobile Carriers do not support SMS Delivery Reports (for instance, the majority of US Carriers). In these instances, the status of the SMS provided by our `sms/get_history` and `sms/query_status` APIs will show the sms status as "queued" for these messages. If your application is dependent on the confirmation of SMS delivery, we would advise that you test against numbers from each of the different Mobile Carriers that your customers would be using, to determine if all these Carriers support SMS Delivery Reports. Do note, that SMS Delivery Reports are still a best-effort service, and you should still handle for cases where the status is not updated. #Charges Charges apply for SMS that are sent via this API. SMS are charged based on destination and in per multipart SMS. Charges still apply if the SMS was block by the recipient's telco. Please check the [Pricing Section](http://developer.hoiio.com/pricing) for charges or you may retrieve the rates with [sms/get_rate](doc:sms-rate) API.
