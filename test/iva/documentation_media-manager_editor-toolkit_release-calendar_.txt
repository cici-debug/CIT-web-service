								About Release Events: Media Manager treats any new availability of an entertainment program as a ‘Release event”. The Theatrical Release Calendar includes two types of releases: Limited and Wide. Wide release means that a title is showing in all major US theaters. Some titles may initially be released in a limited number of theaters usually followed by showings in more theaters at a later date. Occasionally a new title stays in limited release. We also incude titles originally in wide release that are re-released in a limited number of theaters. For example: “Wake in Fright” was released in 1971 and was re-released in New York and LA in October 2012.
