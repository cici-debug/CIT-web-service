								Baseline and IVA have worked together to provide a feed that will be updated weekly and made available to Baseline customers. This feed will include all the meta data you will need, including IVA’s Published ID and matching Baseline ID. Please contact your Baseline Representative for access to this feed and read through the Baseline Data Dictionary to understand all the fields contained in this feed.

								Step 3: Video
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Now that you have ingested the data, use the Video API to create links to the content for use in your own player. IVA suggests having a procedure that dynamically generates the URL on the fly.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:a
								VIDEO API
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To construct a valid video API call you will need the following information:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Customer number
							Element:li
								Secret token
							Element:li
								Videokbrate – chosen from the available encodes
							Element:li
								Published ID of the video
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In the example below we will assume that you will be using the cmd=6 and fmt=4 parameters. For more information on those please see the full Video API documentation. This example shows how to properly join your secret token along with your URL to be hashed. Customers are required to do an MD5 hash of the Secret Token + URL as a security measure to prevent deep linking to the content. The e parameter is a time to live for the link and is the Unix time for when the link should expire. IVA recommends that you generate these links on the fly and keep the time to live as short as possible ( 10 – 30 min). It is important to note that you need to append the secret token to the front of the URL and lower case the whole string.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For a Secret Token of 1234, the pseudo-code necessary to generate a hash is as follows:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								MD5(lcase(1234http://video.internetvideoarchive.net/player.aspx?customerId=18088&cmd=6&fmt=4&videokbrate=750&publishedid=1757&e=1171159092))
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The Hash returned would be c13c876ea56c6124cba712c050a7ae69.
						Node:

								Finished URL:
