											Q: DO I NEED TO CREATE MORE THAN ONE ACCOUNT IN MEDIA MANAGER?
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											A: You don’t have to create more than one account if your company only has one person using Media Manager. If you have multiple people who use Media Manager, you can now set roles for different people with different levels of access. Administrators can turn off accounts in the event of staff turnover. You can create as many accounts as you need.
