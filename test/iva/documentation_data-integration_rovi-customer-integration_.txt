								Step 2: Get the data

							Element:p
								Rovi and IVA have worked together to provide 2 feeds that will be updated once daily Monday – Friday and made available to Rovi customers. These feeds will include all the meta data you will need, including IVA’s Published ID and matching Rovi Program ID. The first feed is single XML file with all the data you need to do your matching and update your records. The second feed is broken up into two flat files. One file contains the data about the program and the other contains the available encodes for the video. Both feeds contain the same data so you only have to get one or the other. Please contact Rovi for access to these feeds and read through the Rovi Feed Data Dictionary to understand all the fields contained in these feeds. Be sure to use the latest version of the feed (v4 or above).

								Step 3: Make a link to the video
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Now that you have ingested all the data you can build the links to the video. To do so you will need the following information:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Customer number
							Element:li
								Secret token
							Element:li
								Videokbrate – chosen from the available encodes
							Element:li
								Published ID of the video
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In the example below we will assume that you will be using the cmd=6 and fmt=4 parameters. For more information on those please see the full
							Element:a
								Video API
								documentation. This example shows how to properly join your secret token along with your URL to be hashed. Customers are required to do an MD5 hash of the Secret Token + URL as a security measure to prevent deep linking to the content. The e parameter is a time to live for the link and is the Unix time for when the link should expire. IVA recommends that you generate these links on the fly and keep the time to live as short as possible ( 10 – 30 min). It is important to note that you need to append the secret token to the front of the URL and lower case the whole string.

For access to either mapping table please contact your Rovi client services team. This mapping table is used to integrate IVA trailers with the AMG data set. The information in the mapping table should be used to connect the IVA video assets and information to your AMD ID’s. Be sure to ingest all information about the video assets so that you can use the information to make programmatic decisions on how and when to use the video. Once you have the video asset ID’s you can then use IVA’s Video API to make links to the video.
