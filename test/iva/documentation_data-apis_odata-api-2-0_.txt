						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In short this is the newest version of our OData API for accessing all of IVA’s content. It is targeted for use by anyone not working with one of our preferred data partners. Check out the
							Element:a
								Data Integration
								page to see if we are working with your data provider or contact our sales team to find out more about data integration. If your data provider is listed there then follow the instructions specific to that data provider.

								IVA’s OData API 2.0 connects you to our huge library of video assets, our massive ever growing metadata collection, and our amassing number of images. Our video assets include: movie trailers, TV series, season and episode trailers, video game trailers, music videos and much, much more! Our data collection is expanding daily and our API is designed to easily allow you to aggregate our data to your application or web site. IVA has partnered with one of the top companies, Microsoft, in cloud based computing (Azure) to run this data service to ensure that it is the most reliable, scalable, and portable system in the industry.
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								The IVA OData API 2.0 is built using OData (Open Data Protocol) (for powerful queries) and it leverages web technologies such as HTTP, Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) and JSON.For more information on oData please visit their web site http://www.odata.org/.

								Features
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								RESTful – IVA’s OData API 2.0 incorporates Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture.
							Element:br
								This makes the system easy to use and easy to understand. Data can be accessed using simple,
							Element:br
								intuitive URLs to content. For example: http://api.internetvideoarchive.com/2.0/DataService/
							Element:br
								EntertainmentPrograms would return all EntertainmentPrograms.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								EntertaInmentPrograms – All of IVA’s content is now integrated into a single collection of
							Element:br
								Entertainment Programs that allows users to search across TV, Movies, Music, Games and Other
							Element:br
								entertainment content. Users can also specify exact Entertainment Program types if they wish.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								TV Data – TV content is now organized and searchable by TV Series, TV Seasons, and TV Episodes with a Series -> Season -> Episode hierarchy.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Unlimited Filtering – All of the IVA collections can be queried using every property in the collection. Filtering operators include equal (Eq), not equal (Ne), greater than (Gt), greater than or equal to (Ge), less than (Lt), less than or equal to (Le), And, Or, and Not. For a complete list of all filtering options visit oDATA query options.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								IVA Warning – IVA’s database now includes “red band” content and foreign content that is not suitable for general audiences. These video assets are available in the VideoAssets collection where the IVAWarning property is set to ‘true’. This flags the content so that you can choose whether or not to include it on your site.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Joining Data Server Side – IVA’s OData API 1.0 allows developers to join various associated collections of data together to reduce round trip request. This improves efficiency and performance.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Security Options – In addition to using a DeveloperID Token appended to the URL, developers can now pass the DeveloperID in the request header. IVA also offers Basic Authentication options for subscribers with a CustomerID and password.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Service Limiting – IVA’s OData API 2.0 uses rate limiting by IP address, and DeveloperID. This rate-limiting ensures that access to the service is available.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Data Formats – IVA’s OData API 2.0 are available in ATOM and JSON formats. Default is JSON and is now a cleaner more lightweight version than what was previously returned by our OData 1.0 API.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Compatibility and Accessibility – IVA’s OData API 2.0 was built using open standard OData, so it
							Element:br
								is compatible with a host of OData-Ready applications like Excel, Web Browsers, and various Client Libraries.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Client Libraries – These programming libraries make it easy to consume IVA’s OData services. These libraries include Javascript, PHP, Java, Windows Phone 7 Series, iPhone (Objective C), Ruby, .NET and many others. For a complete list visit the
							Element:a
								OData SDK
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								GetEncodes() Method – This provides a secure way to get hashed URLs to video content for any video resource.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Documentation – As with any other OData service, you can browse the top level endpoint (or any
							Element:br
								intermediate resource) to discover the sub-resources available, or you can use the documentation to guide your exploration.
