														Title Tracker is a unique new personalized interface from IVA that allows the employees of our clients to stay up-to-date regarding trailers and information for new movies, home videos, and games scheduled for release. You choose the titles you want to track, and you pick the frequency of the alerts you want to receive. Your Title Tracker page lets you filter your list by media type and remove titles you no longer wish to track. Keep reading for information on how to set up your account and enable tracking for the first time.
