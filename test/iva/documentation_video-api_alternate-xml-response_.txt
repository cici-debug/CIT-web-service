														The IVA Video API works seamlessly to deliver video to many different players. However, we know that some players have trouble following the redirect of the “cmd= 6” option in our video API. In many cases it is because the developer is not using the proper application URL from step one of the video API. So it often makes sense to stop and check the player requirements for video, or for the developer to simply recheck the application URL as this is the simplest fix for the problem.

														If this fails, and the player just cannot follow the redirect to the video, your alternative is to use the option “cmd = 3”. This option, instead of telling our API to redirect to the video, instead returns an XML response with information about the video including the direct video URL. You can then parse the XML and grab the video link to pass directly to the player. (IVA suggests that you do NOT cache the links to these videos as they have an expiration date after which they no longer work.) Using this option will cause a slight delay in getting the video because of the extra steps needed on the server side of your website or application. If you still need to use this option you will create the video API links as described in the documentation except to change “cmd = 6” to “cmd =3”.

								In most cases using this implementation of the Video API will throw off the results in our analytics reporting. The work around for this is to pass the header “X-Forwarded-For”. This will pass the originating IP address of the user giving us the data we need to populate accurate reports for your account. See the
