														Do you have an international user base? If so you should be taking advantage of IVA’s library of localized content. IVA has more than 26,000 assets in different languages and with language subtitles. Engage your users with the content that is most relevant to them by showing trailers in their native language or with subtitles.

											How To Implement Localized Content
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											IVA makes localizing content by language very easy. All the meta data you need is provided in the Video Asset details. Localizing content varies depending on how you are implementing video, so a good way to start is by checking the Data Dictionary documentation for your data provider to see what data is included around the video assets. If you are not sure about your implementation, contact our client services team to schedule a call and review your project. Below are details on the fields you use to decide what content to display to the end user.

										Element:table
										Element:tbody
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											Language Spoken
										Element:td
											The primary language spoken in the Video Asset which may not be the same as the language in the Entertainment Program. This property is useful for localizing video content in combination with TargetCountry property. Default = -1.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											Language Subtitled
										Element:td
											The language subtitled in the VideoAsset which may not be the same as the language in the EntertainmentProgram. This property is useful for localizing video content in other countries in combination with TargetCountry property. When the video asset does not have subtitles, this property is set to -1. Default = -1.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											Target Country
										Element:td
											This denotes whether the VideoAsset was made for a specific country. This property is rarely used. The default = -1.
										Element:tr
										Element:td

											*Foreign Films Released In The US
									Node:

										Element:p
											Every video asset in the IVA database is attached to an Entertainment Program( EP) For example “World War Z”, a movie from 2013 has over 100 video assets, including, a main or default trailer , alternate versions of the trailer, versions in different languages/subtitles, behind the scenes featurettes, and clips (Scenes or Samples) Some movies include interviews with the cast., or making-of featurettes. Since “World War Z” is a US film in English, all other language versions / subtitled versions are listed as alternate versions. Use the “language spoken” and “language subtitled” fields to filter as desired.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In the case of a movie filmed and released in another country that is also released in the US trailers in the language of the country of origin are listed as the main or default trailer while trailers subtitled in English or intended for the US are listed as alternates. Sometimes the US distributor will make trailers available while the foreign distributor does not. In these cases there is no default trailer attached to the main EP, and the US version of the trailer is designated as “alternate content.”

											Target Country
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											IVA does NOT set the target country as “US” for US movies. The US trailer of a US-made movie is considered a world-wide trailer for the film, therefore ‘target country’ is left blank.

											When to Use Default Video Asset With Localization
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When localizing content, display assets that match your audience first and list all other video assets as options for your users. If there is not a language option that fits your user then the default video asset should be the main trailer shown.
