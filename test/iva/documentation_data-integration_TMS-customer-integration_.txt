								TMS and IVA have worked together to provide a feed that will be updated once daily Monday – Friday and made available to TMS customers.

								There are different versions of the data feeds on the FTP. Be sure to use the appropriate one. The newest version is v4 and is recommended. If you are unsure of which one to use, please contact our

								TMSVideoV4 & TMS_Root_v4 – (recommended version) In this newest version of the feed IVA has removed the defaultVideoAsset property and added the following: mezzanine_digitized_date and dateCreated.
							Element:li
								TMS_Root_v3 – This version includes the GroupPermissionID field. Any asset where this field appears requires special permissions to access. You would need to know if your account has permission for these assets. Contact support if you are unsure.
							Element:li
								TMS_Root – This version uses the TMS Root ID’s as the key value instead of the TMS ID. Anyone not using the TMS English US data set should use this file with the Root ID’s.
							Element:li
								TMSVideoV2 – This updated version has some additional fields needed to make appropriate programmatic decisions about the content.
							Element:li
								TMSVideo – This is our older version and should not be used by any new customers.

								VIDEO API
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To construct a valid video API call you will need the following information:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Customer number
							Element:li
								Secret token
							Element:li
								Videokbrate – chosen from the available encodes
							Element:li
								Published ID of the video
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In the example below we will assume that you will be using the cmd=6 and fmt=4 parameters. For more information on those please see the full
							Element:a
								Video API
								documentation. This example shows how to properly join your secret token along with your URL to be hashed. Customers are required to do an MD5 hash of the Secret Token + URL as a security measure to prevent deep linking to the content. The e parameter is a time to live for the link and is the Unix time for when the link should expire. IVA recommends that you generate these links on the fly and keep the time to live as short as possible ( 10 – 30 min). It is important to note that you need to append the secret token to the front of the URL and lower case the whole string.
						Node:
						(type) c

								Secret Token = 1234
