														2. Intellectual Property Rights
													Element:br
														The APIs and the content they contain were all created for promotional and informational use. Thumbnail images are specifically created for linking to video. Each image is an integral part of the reference databases which are designed to assist in the acquisition and selection of entertainment products. When taken together, each of these databases not only facilitates access to audiovisual information, but allow for the side by side comparison of entertainment products essential to choice in a competitive marketplace. The content and the databases are not meant to substitute for the work they depict, but rather to compliment and enhance the promotional information about the work they depict through the provision of ready access to equitable and competitive information that permits the viewer to make their own expedient judgments about the work. At the same time, they are not necessarily endorsed by the producer of the work they represent nor should they be considered to be indicative of the quality of that work in any way.
													Element:br
														The content contained in the APIs is subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under United States and foreign laws and international conventions. The composers, musicians, performers, videographers, producers and other creators maintain their underlying rights. Content contained in the APIs is provided to youAS IS for private promotional use and may not be publicly broadcast or displayed; licensed, sold or otherwise exploited for a fee paid by the viewer. IVA reserves all rights not expressly granted in and to the content. You agree not to remove notices, circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security features of the APIs.
													Element:br
														The APIs are controlled and offered from facilities in the United States of America. IVA makes no representations that the content is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the APIs from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.
