											Q: How long does it take for my proprietary video to go live?
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											A: Each new title that needs to be added to the database gets put in a queue each day. Generally it takes 15 – 30 minutes to encode a title in the various formats needed to play on all the various screens. So the turnaround time will depend on where your video enters the queue and how big the queue is on that day. We generally promise that proprietary content will go live inside of 24 hours.
