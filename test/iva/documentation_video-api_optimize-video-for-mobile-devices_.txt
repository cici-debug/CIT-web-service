														By following these best practices you will balance the performance of the progressive download with the quality of the video. Higher quality video provides the better experience for your end user. IVA recommends using one of our Adaptive bitrate formats (HLS, HSS, HDS, Dash) when ever possible.

											How To Optimize

											Step 1 – Bandwidth Detection
										Element:br
											Almost every mobile platform can tell an application what type of connection it is using. Ex: Edge, 3G, WiFi. The speed of the connection can give you a starting point for what bit rate you want to start at. Choosing a rate that is too high can cause a longer load time and cause buffering pauses. Choosing a rate that is too low results in a poor user experience.

											Step 2 – Monitor Buffer events and switch rates
										Element:br
											Monitoring for buffering events allows your application to know if the device is having connection issues. When a buffering event is detected you can use the “start” option in the Video API to tell the player to use a lower kb rate and to start that video at the time when the video started to buffer.

										Element:p
											Example: you are playing a 2500 kbps video on a tablet and it starts to buffer 35 seconds into the video. Tell your player to use the URL to the 1500 kbps video and append the start option to the end of the URL; “&start=35”.
