								Paid subscribers to IVA’s service use our Video API with our Published ID’s to deliver videos to the player of their choice. To make a proper request for a video, you will need a customer ID number, a security token, and a published ID. The customer ID number and security token are provided in your welcome letter. Published ID’s are available two ways: If you have your own data, use our OData API to create a query and do your own matching. If you are using a data provider use one of the matching tables that we provide for our data partners. Once you have created a proper URL, pass it to your player and the link will do an instant 302 redirect to the file on our CDN.

							Element:tr
							Element:td
								customerid
							Element:span

							Element:td
								ID’s are assigned to paid subscription users by their salesman. It is a unique ID used for security and customization purposes. Ex customerid=45678
							Element:tr
							Element:td
								videokbrate
							Element:span
								(required)
							Element:td
								This specifies the speed of the file you want to play. Consult the Encodes Entity to see what speeds and formats are available for each video asset. Available formats and speeds are:
							Element:br
							Element:br
								MP4 – 80, 212, 450, 750, 1500, 2500(HD sources only) Kbps
							Element:br
								HLS, HSS, HDS, Dash are multi-bitrate formats and do not require VideoKbrate. You can however, use minrate and maxrate parameters to adjust bitrates.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
								publishedid
							Element:span
								(required)
							Element:td
								Every video asset in our library is given a unique number known as its Published ID. Ex: publishedid=123345
							Element:tr

								for a time converter.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
								h
							Element:span
								(required)
							Element:td
								The hash code for the requested URL. You will create this unique number for every video request by using your Secret Token and doing an MD5 hash of the entire link including the ‘e’ parameter. Check out the Encryption Documentation below.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
								start
							Element:td
								The start option can be used to tell supported players where to start the video. This is useful when detecting buffering events and you want to start the video at the point of the event. For example: Generate links to a few different videokbrates. If a buffering event occurs you can tell the player to switch to a lower videokbrate and append the time in seconds to start. To take advantage of this, make sure your player supports range requests. You do not need to MD5 hash the start or end options when creating a URL as long as you append it after the hash code in the link. Format: start=25 where 25 is the number of seconds into the video you would like to start.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
								end
							Element:td
								The end option works like just like the start option only that it tells the player when to stop playing the video. Format end=55 where 55 is the number of seconds into the video from the beginning when to stop the video.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
								minrate
							Element:td
								Used with Adaptive bitrate technologies like HLS, HSS, HDS, and Dash. This parameter is in bits per second (bps). To set a minimum bitrate of 1200 Kbps, use minrate=1200000.Currently IVA offer 600Kbps, 1200Kbps, 2000Kbps, 2500Kbps(HD 720p)* and 5000Kbps(HD 1080p)*
							Element:br
								*-when source is available. Use the following values to limit (212000, 350000, 600000, 1200000, 2000000, 2500000, 3500000)
							Element:tr
							Element:td
								maxrate
							Element:td

							Element:tr
							Element:td
								sub
							Element:td
								Pass a unique string with this variable to segment reporting inside of Media Manager. For example if you wanted to see the video traffic specific to your iOS application you could have all the links generated with sub=iOS. When you look at the analytics you can choose to see the information for any of the links that used that sub tag. Be sure to add this before the hash code.

								Apply security settings. IVA requires customers to secure the links they are making by setting a time to live (TTL) and applying an MD5 hash code to the link to prevent deep linking from unwanted sources. To make the hash you will need your customer account number and your security token. Read the steps below for more information on creating this hash code.

											ASP.NET: Use the built in function FormsAuthentication.HashPasswordForStoringInConfigFile(StringToEncrypt, “MD5″)

											Important: Although MD5 is available in ActionScript 2.0 we recommend not including your security token inside an SWF as SWFs can easily be decompiled allowing other sites to use your IVA account.

											Expiration
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In order to prevent a valid URL from being “hot linked” for an extended period of time an expiration, or Time To Live (TTL) is required. The expiration for the video.internetvideoarchive.net/player.aspx is measured in the number of seconds from 1/1/1970. Below is a vbscript example of creating a TTL of 3 minutes. (Server date is based on Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT.)
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											Public Function makettl()TimeoutDate = DateAdd("n", 3, Now) makettl = DateDiff("s", "01/01/1970 00:00:00", TimeoutDate) ' convert to Unix time End Function
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											GMT Offset - the difference between your server's time and GMT Time.One way to get GMT Offset is to use jScript: GMT Offset = 0 - new Date().gettimezonetoffset() // GMT offset in minutes of the server (sign inversed to bring into line with reality)
