								Prerequisites
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
								For best results, work with one of the data companies listed
							Element:a
								here
								for getting rich metadata and program information. IVA’s trailers can be linked to your existing data from 3rd Party IDs (like Gracenote, Rovi, IMDB, etc). If you are not working with a data company, it’s fine, you are more than welcome to use our metadata.
							Element:li
								PAID or FREE? If you would like to display IVA’s content without ads, want to insert your own advertising, or need more than 500 requests per hour, you will need a subscription to IVA.
							Element:a
								Contact sales
								for more information. Not ready for a subscription just yet? IVA offers limited access to our OData API and allows the use of our Ad Supported Free Trailer Player to display IVA’s content. Either option will allow you access to unlimited video plays.

								Subscription clients and test accounts are issued developer ID’s by our

								customer service
								team once a test account has been set up. If you are not interested in a subscription, use our free
							Element:a
								developer sign-up
								form and you will be emailed a developer ID.

						Node:

								Start by deciding what data is important to you. OData is extremely flexible and able to provide the specific data you need to work with IVA’s contet. Review the

								data dictionary
								for available metadata. Store and update this data as often as possible.

								Start with an ingest query to get the current catalog.

											Live Example :
											Next, set up an update query to retrieve any new or updated video assets. Run your updates as often as possible. IVA recommends limiting your updates to 50 or 100 assets at a time for this update query and paging through to get all results. The following example query will give you all new video assets added or any video assets where data about the program has changed. With OData, you can add additional filters to get back the data that is important to you (example: just movies, or TV clips, game previews, etc).

										Element:ul
										Element:li
											LanguageSpoken – Tells you the language spoken in the trailer.
										Element:li
											LanguageSubtitled – Tells you the language subtitled in the trailer. Some movie trailers have many alternate trailers that are spoken in English and subtitled in various different languages. Be sure to handle for those if you do not want to display them.
										Element:li
											ExpirationDate – On some assets, mostly related to TV content, the copyright holder will impose an expiration date. Pay close attention to this field to avoid broken links.
										Element:li
											OkToEncode AndServe – If set to false the video will not stream and should not be used.
										Element:li
											RequiresIVAPlayer – These assets must be played back using the IVA player.
										Element:li
											TargetCountry – If a trailer is targeted to a specific country it will be reflected in this value. Anything set to -1 should be considered as the US trailer or for world wide use.
										Element:li
											Media Type – Describes the type of video asset (Interview, Behind the Scene, Alternate, etc…).
										Element:li
											Sequence – For TV season records this will be the season number and for episodic records this will be the episode number for the season.
										Element:li
											Overall Sequence – Applies to the episodic records and will be the overall episode number of the series.
										Element:li
											DefaultVideoAsset – If you are displaying multiple trailers for the user to choose, the default video asset should be displayed first. This is the most recent trailer added for a particular program.
										Element:li
											AllowAds – In rare instances copyright holders will restrict the use of ads around a particular piece of content. This field denotes whether or not an asset has this restriction.
