								Prerequisites
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
								For best results, you need to be working with one of the data companies listed
							Element:a
								here
								as Entertainment Express API uses 3rd Party IDs (like Gracenote, Rovi, IMDB, etc) to retrieve trailers.
							Element:li
								PAID or FREE? IVA offers limited access to it’s data and video with rate limiting and advertisements. If you need more than 1,000 requests per hour and/or want your own advertising then you need a subscription to IVA.

								STEP 1: Create an Application ID
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Application IDs allow you to customize the API response and are required for authentication. Professional allows you to create as many Application Ids you want. Standard is limited to one.

								STEP 2: Server Side or Client Side
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Entertainment Express can be implemented completely using client side Javascript. The enpoints support CORS and return JSON to be easily parsed and displayed inside your UI.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Ideally, on your individual title pages you would include a call to Entertainment Express passing a 3rd party Id (ex: Gracenote/TMS ID for a movie) and Entertainment Express would return the matching Video Assets and you can display images, title of the asset and links to the videos.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you add titles to your database with new IDs, the trailers would be displayed as soon as they are available without any additional coding.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Server Side
								implementations can be used with Entertainment Express. In situations like this, you would likely set up a proxy to cache the results and render the images, title, and links to videos dynamically on the server, rather than client side javascript. This offers more security as your token and Application ID are hidden from end users.
