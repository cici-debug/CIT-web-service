								Step 2: Get the data
						Node:

							Element:p
								Gracenote provides their customers with IVA’s database of Published IDs. Select the Published ID for the title you want video for. This ID is only the Main Entertainment Program ID.

								Step 3: Get available encodes
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Each title in our database is encoded in multiple formats designed to meet the wide variety of screens and operating systems used by consumers to watch content. Not every encode is available for every title; HD was not around for older films, for example.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Insert the Published ID for the title you want (244133 in the example below) plus your Developer ID into the URL shown below and IVA OData API will return back the XML with all of the available encodes. Decide the FileType and Rate you want. Get the URL property for that FileType and Rate. You will need this to make a working link in Step 4. Here is the URL:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								http://api.internetvideoarchive.com/2.0/DataService/Encodes()?$filter=PublishedId%20eq%20244133&developerid={your-id}
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The table below lists the properties that are returned in the XML from the query. Use any of these properties to make your query more specific. Example: If you just want to know if a title is available in HD (Rate = 2500):

						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To make a link to a video you need your Customer ID, your Security Token, and the base URL you got from the Encodes Entity above.
