														The documentation for IVA’s Free Trailer API describes how to use our free ad-supported player. First, you need to get a developer ID. Next you should learn how to get Published ID’s from our
													Element:a
														Data API’s
														. You can use the Free Trailer API with our Published ID’s to embed videos on your site.

								Embedding Video On Your Website

								Embedding video has never been easier! The new iframe embed code makes it very simple to embed a video with no need for Javascript. IVA’s new iframe embed code also uses a newer player than the previous version of our free player and has built in HTML5 support adding the ability to reach mobile devices too. Use the tool below to generate a custom embed code to use. You can choose the size, skin, playlist and auto start options to meet your needs. Copy the code from the tool and replace “{ INSERT PUBLISHEDID }” with the published ID of the content you want to play or choose one of our auto generated playlists.
