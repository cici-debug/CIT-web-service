														Report tags allow customers to segment their reporting/analytics. Whether you are using our Video API to create links to the content, our Cross Platform Player, or both, you can add report tags to each that will allow you to analyze your data in a meaningful way. Here are a couple of use cases that will illustrate how to use report tags to get the analytics you want.

														Use Case 1:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														You need to see analytics for videos being featured on the homepage of your website.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4

														Solutions:

														Cross Platform Player: Set the report tag inside the embed code of our cross platform player to “Featured”.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Example:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														<script type='text/javascript' src='//video.internetvideoarchive.net/player/ivaplayer6.js'></script> <div id='ivadiv'></div> <script type='text/javascript'> IVAPlayer.init('ivadiv', { customerid: 9999999, publishedid: '769190', reporttag: 'featured', autolist: '', minrate: '', maxrate: '', playerid: 999 }); </script>
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Video API: Set the report tag (sub=featured) on any call to the video API from that section of the website only.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														http://video.internetvideoarchive.net/video.mp4?cmd=6&fmt=4&customerid=12345&videokbrate=2500&publishedid=907755&e=1411499881&sub=featured&h=ff77bf0651ef971d63c6e1431cab8c9d
