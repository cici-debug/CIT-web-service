											Adding Subscribers and Sending a Message
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The first step in integrating messaging into your system is to create a distribution list, which is referred to simply as a "
										Element:a
											list
											" in the API, and then develop ways for subscribers to be automatically added to your subscription database.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											A list itself is a powerful tool for grouping subscriptions for a purpose. For example, you can group some subscriptions into one list for general marketing promotions and news, and create another list with a select number of those same subscriptions for more exclusive information. Or, for internal communications, separate lists can be created for various departments and teams.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											A couple of ways you can organically add new subscriptions is by creating an online sign-up page (OSP) or a
										Element:a
											mobile keyword
											, which enables people to directly opt-in to your database. If you have an existing customer management system, you can develop a link between your database and ours that can keep contact details synced. You can also create multiple subscriptions at once with the
										Element:a
											PUT Subscription
											API call. Note that you must abide by
										Element:a
											industry regulations
											and have the expressed consent of your subscribers to be sent messages through our API.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In the case of an OSP, people can directly submit their contact information, like name, mobile number, and email address, via a web form to receive text-message notifications or email newsletters. Once a person has successfully filled out your OSP, your system could create a new subscription for that person in our database with the PUT Subscription call by providing that person’s contact info. The subscriber’s newly created subscription ID can be sent to you as a PUSH Notification, which you can design to automatically trigger an automated welcome message to be sent to the subscriber through the
										Element:a
											PUT Message
											call.

											Mobile Keyword
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											A mobile keyword can act in the same way by automatically adding subscribers when they text in your mobile keyword to your assigned short code number. To create a keyword, use the
										Element:a
											PUT Keyword
											call. However, the only personal information that is collected by default is the subscription's mobile phone number. To gather other subscription information, you can set up
										Element:a
											Inbound Messaging
											where the subscriber can send a text to another keyword with their personal information, which is then pushed to the Receiving URL you have designated in My Account for PUSH Notifications. From that point, you should develop a way to process and format that information to update that subscription's data in our system through the
										Element:a
											POST Subscription
											call.

										Element:p
											Now that you've implemented ways to add subscriptions, you can now focus on sending messages to them. Messages can be sent with the
										Element:a
											PUT Message
											call to individual subscriptions or lists via any combination of supported channels: SMS or MMS message, or email. Mail merge can be integrated to include the first and/or last name of subscriptions, and the message can be scheduled to go out immediately or at a later date and time.

											Register SNS Account and Publication
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:p
											Our REST API also allows you to register an SNS account and publish a post to multiple social networking platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, simultaneously. A Facebook account, Facebook page, or Twitter account can be registered in your SNS account list with the
										Element:a
											PUT SNS Account
											call. A post can be published immediately or scheduled for a specific date and time using the
										Element:a
											PUT Publication
											call. Other parameters can also be set, such as privacy level and shared media for Facebook posts (e.g., links, images, or videos).
