					The post browsed products API allows you to recommend products to someone based on their product viewing history. Similar to the P
				Element:a
					roduct Recommendation API
					, this endpoint uses one item ID as the anchor for the output. For instance, if you know that one of your customers has recently viewed an Xbox one, it is likely that they may be also interested in purchasing a PlayStation 4, or Nintento Wii. Some example use cases for this data:
