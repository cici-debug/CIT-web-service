																	The
																Element:b
																	Summarize Within
																	task finds the point, line, or polygon features (or portions of these features) that are within the boundaries of polygons in another layer. For example:
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:ul
																Element:li
																	Given a layer of watershed boundaries and a layer of land-use boundaries by land-use type, calculate total acreage of land-use type for each watershed.
																Element:li
																	Given a layer of parcels in a county and a layer of city boundaries, summarize the average value of vacant parcels within each city boundary.
																Element:li
																	Given a layer of counties and a layer of roads, summarize the total mileage of roads by road type within each county.
															Node:

																Element:p
																	You can think of Summarize Within as taking two layers and stacking them on top of each other. One of the layers, the
																Element:span
																	sumWithinLayer
																	must be a polygon layer, and imagine that these polygon boundaries are all colored red. The other layer, the
																Element:span
																	summaryLayer
																	, can be any feature typeâ€”point, line, or polygon. After stacking these layers on top of each other, you peer down through the stack and count the number of features in the
																Element:span
																	summaryLayer
																	that fall within the polygons with the red boundaries (the
																Element:span
																	sumWithinLayer
																	). Not only can you count the number of features, you can calculate simple statistics about the attributes of the features in the
																Element:span
																	summaryLayer
																	, such as sum, mean, minimum, maximum, and so on.

							Element:td
							Element:p
								This is a field of the

								features are parcels. One of the fields of the parcels is
							Element:span
								Status
								which contains two values: VACANT and OCCUPIED. To calculate the total area of vacant and occupied parcels within the boundaries of cities, use
