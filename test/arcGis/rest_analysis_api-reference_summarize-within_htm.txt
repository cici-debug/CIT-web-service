																	The
																Element:b
																	Summarize Within
																	task finds the point, line, or polygon features (or portions of these features) that are within the boundaries of polygons in another layer. For example:
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:ul
																Element:li
																	Given a layer of watershed boundaries and a layer of land-use boundaries by land-use type, calculate total acreage of land-use type for each watershed.
																Element:li
																	Given a layer of parcels in a county and a layer of city boundaries, summarize the average value of vacant parcels within each city boundary.
																Element:li
																	Given a layer of counties and a layer of roads, summarize the total mileage of roads by road type within each county.
															Node:

																Element:p
																	You can think of Summarize Within as taking two layers and stacking them on top of each other. One of the layers, the
																Element:span
																	sumWithinLayer
																	must be a polygon layer, and imagine that these polygon boundaries are all colored red. The other layer, the
																Element:span
																	summaryLayer
																	, can be any feature type—point, line, or polygon. After stacking these layers on top of each other, you peer down through the stack and count the number of features in the
																Element:span
																	summaryLayer
																	that fall within the polygons with the red boundaries (the
																Element:span
																	sumWithinLayer
																	). Not only can you count the number of features, you can calculate simple statistics about the attributes of the features in the
																Element:span
																	summaryLayer
																	, such as sum, mean, minimum, maximum, and so on.

								features are parcels. One of the fields of the parcels is

								Status
								which contains two values: VACANT and OCCUPIED. To calculate the total area of vacant and occupied parcels within the boundaries of cities, use
