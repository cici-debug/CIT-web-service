																	The

																	Find Hot Spots
																	task analyzes point data (such as crime incidents, traffic accidents, or trees) or field values associated with points or area features (such as the number of people in each census tract or the total sales for retail stores). It finds statistically significant spatial clusters of high values (hot spots) and low values (cold spots). For point data when no field is specified, hot spots are locations with lots of points and cold spots are locations with very few points.

																	The result map layer shows hot spots in red and cold spots in blue. The darkest red features indicate the strongest clustering of high values or point densities; you can be 99 percent confident that the clustering associated with these features could not be the result of random chance. Similarly, the darkest blue features are associated with the strongest spatial clustering of low values or the lowest point densities. Features that are beige are not part of a statistically significant cluster; the spatial pattern associated with these features could very likely be the result of random processes and random chance.

								If the input analysis layer (

								is specified, the result will be points. For all other scenarios (polygons or points when no

								analysisField
								is specified) the output is polygons.
							Element:p
								The result layer has the following attributes:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								an ID field (
							Element:span
								FID
								)—An Integer field with a unique value for every feature.

								—When an

								analysisField
								is specified, an Integer field is created with values reflecting the number of points in each aggregation polygon. If an
							Element:span
								aggregationPolygonLayer
								is specified, these polygons are used for aggregation. Otherwise, a fishnet polygon mesh is created to overlay the points, and the squares in the fishnet mesh are used as aggregation polygons.

								Hot/Cold Intensity
								—a numeric (double) field with standard deviations representing the intensity of spatial clustering.
							Element:li

								Confidence Bin
								—use this field for symbolizing the results. Values range from -3 to +3 and reflect statistical significance. Use blue to draw values less than zero and red to draw values greater than zero. Use the darkest blue for features equal to -3, medium blue for -2, and light blue for -1. Use the darkest red for features equal to 3, medium red for 2, and the lightest red or pink for 1. A confidence bin value of zero means no statistically significant clustering, and these features should be draw in white or beige (the color selected should be neutral and not draw attention at all).

							Element:p
								The

								Find Hot Spots
								task calculates the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic (pronounced G-i-star) for each feature in a feature layer. The service works by looking at each feature within the context of neighboring features. To be a statistically significant hot spot, a feature will have a high value or incident count and will be surrounded by other features with high values or incident counts. The local sum for a feature and its neighbors is compared proportionally to the sum of all features; when the local sum is very different from the expected local sum, and when that difference is too large to be the result of random chance, a statistically significant

											Hot spot analysis considerations
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											There are three things to consider when undertaking any hot spot analysis:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											What is the Analysis Field?
										Element:p
											The hot spot analysis tool assesses whether high or low values (the number of crimes, accident severity, or dollars spent on sporting goods, for example) cluster spatially. The field containing those values is your Analysis Field. When the Analysis Layer represents incident points and you are only interested in locating high and low incident densities, select NO ANALYSIS FIELD. When you select NO ANALYSIS FIELD, the Find Hot Spots service will overlay the incidents points with a fishnet and count the number of incidents within each fishnet square. The incident count values will then be used as the Analysis Field.
										Element:li
											What is the question?
										Element:p
											This may seem obvious, but how you construct the Analysis Field determines the types of questions you can answer. Are you most interested in determining where you have lots of incidents or where high/low values for a particular attribute cluster spatially? If so, run the Find Hot Spot service on the raw values or raw incident counts. This type of analysis is particularly helpful for resource allocation types of problems. Alternatively (or in addition), you may be interested in locating areas with unexpectedly high values in relation to some other variable. If you are analyzing foreclosures, for example, you probably expect more foreclosures in locations with more homes (said another way, at some level, you expect the number of foreclosures to be a function of the number of houses). For each Analysis Layer area, divide the number of foreclosures by the number of homes, then run the Find Hot Spots service on this ratio. For this analysis, you are no longer asking Where are there lots of foreclosures?; instead, you are asking Where are there unexpectedly high numbers of foreclosures, given the number of homes? By creating a rate or ratio prior to analysis, you can control for certain expected relationships (for example, the number of crimes is a function of population; the number of foreclosures is a function of housing stock) and will then be identifying unexpected hot/cold spots.
										Element:li
											Does the analysis layer contain at least 30 features?
										Element:p
											Results aren't reliable with less than 30 features.
