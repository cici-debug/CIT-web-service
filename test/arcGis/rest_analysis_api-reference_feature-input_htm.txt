																	All standard spatial analysis tasks have input parameters that take features as their input. Features can be input in one of two ways:
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:ol
																Element:li
																	Specify a URL to a feature service layer (or a map service layer that has
																Element:span
																	query
																	as one of its capabilities) along with an optional filter.
																Element:li
																	Specify a feature collection.

						Node:

							Element:p
								You can give the URL to a
							Element:a
								feature service layer
								or a
							Element:a
								map service layer
								that has
							Element:a
								query capability
								.

								If your layer is on a secure server, you will need to provide a token that allows the analysis service to access your layer.
						Node:

								Note:
						Node:

							Element:p
								You cannot run any of the analysis tasks using data from ArcGIS Server map or feature services that are not publically accessible. That is, the URL to the service must be a public URL, not one only accessible behind a firewall. If you use a nonpublic map or feature service, you'll receive an error saying that the URL is not accessible.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In addition to supplying the URL, you can supply a filter string for an SQL WHERE clause but without the WHERE statement, for example
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "url": "http://services.arcgis.com/f126c8da131543019b05e4bfab6fc6ac/arcgis/rest/services/hospitals/FeatureServer/0", "filter": "STATE='CA'" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If no filter is supplied, all features are available to the analysis service.

								featureCollection
						Node:

								The other option is to send a

								featureCollection
								instead of a layer. Filters are supported with feature collections.For more information on feature collections and feature sets, see the Javascript documentation:
