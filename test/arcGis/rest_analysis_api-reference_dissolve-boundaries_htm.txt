																	The
																Element:b
																	Dissolve Boundaries
																	task finds polygons that overlap or share a common boundary and merges them together to form a single polygon.
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:p
																	You can control which boundaries are merged by specifying a field. For example, if you have a layer of counties, and each county has a
																Element:span
																	State_Name
																	attribute, you can dissolve boundaries using the
																Element:span
																	State_Name
																	attribute. Adjacent counties will be merged together if they have the same value for
																Element:span
																	State_Name
																	. The end result is a layer of state boundaries.

								Description
							Element:tbody

							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								inputLayer
							Element:p
								(Required)
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The layer containing polygon features that will be dissolved.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Syntax
								: As described in detail in the
							Element:a
								Feature Input
								topic, this parameter can be
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								a URL to a feature service layer with an optional filter to select specific features, or
							Element:li
								a feature collection.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Examples
								:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span
								{"url": <feature service layer url>, "filter": <where clause>}
							Element:li
							Element:span
								{"layerDefinition": {}, "featureSet": {}, "filter": <where clause>}
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								dissolveFields
							Element:td
							Element:p
								One or more fields on the
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								that control which polygons are merged. If you don't supply
							Element:span
								dissolveFields
								, or you supply an empty list of fields, polygons that share a common border (that is, they are adjacent) or polygon areas that overlap will be dissolved into one polygon.
							Element:p
								If you do supply values for the
							Element:span
								dissolveFields
								parameter, polygons that share a common border and contain the same value in one or more fields will be dissolved. For example, if you have a layer of counties, and each county has a
							Element:span
								State_Name
								attribute, you can dissolve boundaries using the
							Element:span
								State_Name
								attribute. Adjacent counties will be merged together if they have the same value for
							Element:span
								State_Name
								. The end result is a layer of state boundaries.If two or more fields are specified, the values in these fields must be the same for the boundary to be dissolved.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Example:
							Element:span
								"dissolveFields": ["State_Name", "District"]
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								summaryFields
							Element:td
							Element:p
								A list of field names and statistical summary type that you wish to calculate from the polygons that are dissolved together. For example, if you are dissolving counties based on
							Element:span
								State_Name
								, and each county had a
							Element:span
								Population
								field, you can sum
							Element:span
								Population
								. The result would be a layer of state boundaries with total population.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Syntax
								:
							Element:span
								["fieldName summaryType","fieldName summaryType", ...]
							Element:p
							Element:span
								fieldName
								is the name of one of the numeric fields found in the
							Element:span
								InputLayer
								.
							Element:p
							Element:span
								summaryType
								is one of the following:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span
								Sum
								- Adds the total value of all the points in each polygon
							Element:li
							Element:span
								Mean
								- Calculates the average of all the points in each polygon.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								Min
								- Finds the smallest value of all the points in each polygon.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								Max
								- Finds the largest value of all the points in each polygon.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								Stddev
								- Finds the standard deviation of all the points in each polygon.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Example
								:
							Element:span
								"summaryFields": ["Annual_Sales Sum", "Annual_Sales Min"]
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								outputName
							Element:td
							Element:p
								If provided, the task will create a feature service of the results. You define the name of the service. If
							Element:span
								outputName
								is not supplied, the task will return a feature collection.
							Element:i

							Element:pre

								{ "serviceProperties": { "name": "<service name>" } }
							Element:tr

							Element:ol
							Element:li
							Element:a
								Extent
								(
							Element:span

								)—a bounding box that defines the analysis area. Only those features in the

							Element:li
							Element:a
								Output Spatial Reference
								(

								to periodically check the status of the job and messages as described in the topic
							Element:a
								Checking job status
								. Once the job has successfully completed, you use the
							Element:span
