								Specify the mode of transportation for the analysis.
							Element:p
								Travel modes are managed in ArcGIS Online and can be configured by the administrator of your organization to better reflect your organization's workflows. You need to specify the JSON object containing the settings for a travel mode supported by your organization. To get a list of supported travel modes, execute the
							Element:span
								GetTravelModes
								tool from the
							Element:a
								Utilities service
								.
							Element:p
								The value for the
							Element:span
								travelMode
								parameter should be a JSON object representing travel mode settings. When you use the
							Element:span
								GetTravelModes
								tool from the Utilities service, You get a string representing the travel mode JSON. You need to convert this string to a valid JSON object using your API and then pass the JSON object as the value for the
							Element:span
								travelMode
								parameter.
							Element:p
								For example, below is a string representing the Walking Time travel mode as returned by the
							Element:span
								GetTravelModes
								tool.

								timeOfDay
								value represents the time at which travel begins, or departs, from the input points. The time is specified as Unix time (milliseconds since midnight, January 1 1970).
							Element:p
								The service supports two kinds of traffic: typical and live. Typical traffic references travel speeds that are made up of historical averages for each five-minute interval spanning a week. Live traffic retrieves speeds from a traffic feed that processes phone probe records, sensors, and other data sources to record actual travel speeds and predict speeds for the near future.

								To ensure the task uses typical traffic in locations where it is available, choose a time and day of the week, and then convert the day of the week to one of the following dates from 1990:

								Saturday—1/6/1990
							Element:li
								Sunday—1/7/1990
							Element:p
								Set the time and date as Unix time in milliseconds.
							Element:p
								For example, to solve for 1:03 p.m. on Thursdays, set the time and date to 1:03 p.m., 4 January 1990; and convert to milliseconds (631458180000).
							Element:p

								Name
								—The name of the drive-time area is the same as the name of the point location from which it was created followed by the from- and to-break values of the area.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								FromBreak
								—The travel distance or travel time from which the area begins. This is normally zero, since most travel time polygons start from the input point location. However, non-zero values are present when you specify multiple break values, because all but the first output areas would start from one of the break values.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								ToBreak
								—The travel distance or travel time at which the area ends. If the analysis includes multiple input break values, multiple ToBreakValues are included here but in different rows.
