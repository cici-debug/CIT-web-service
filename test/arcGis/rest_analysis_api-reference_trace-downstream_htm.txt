																	The

																	Trace Downstream
																	task determines the trace, or flow path, in a downstream direction from the points in your analysis layer.
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:p
																	For example, suppose you have point features representing sources of contamination and you want to determine where in your study area the contamination will flow. You can use Trace Downstream to identify the path the contamination will take. This trace can also be divided into individual line segments by specifying a distance value and units. The line being returned can be the total length of the flow path, a specified maximum trace length, or clipped to area features such as your study area. In many cases, if the total length of the trace path is returned, it will be from the source all the way to the ocean.

							Element:li
							Element:span
								Description
								— Describes the source database used in the analysis. US30m-which is derived from the 30m NHDPlusV2.1 for the continental United States, and the 90m HydroSHEDS for the world between 60 degrees North and 56 degrees South, plus some areas in Canada and Alaska north of 60 degrees.

								If line segments are calculated there will be three additional attributes:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span
								FromDistance
								— Is how far down the trace each trace segment starts. The first from distance for each trace is always zero because the first trace segment starts at the origin of the trace.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								ToDistance
								— Is how far down the trace each trace segment stops. The last segment in a trace will have a to distance the equals the total distance.
							Element:li
