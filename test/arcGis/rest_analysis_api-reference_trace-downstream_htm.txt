																	The

																	Trace Downstream
																	task determines the trace, or flow path, in a downstream direction from the points in your analysis layer.
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:p
																	For example, suppose you have point features representing sources of contamination and you want to determine where in your study area the contamination will flow. You can use Trace Downstream to identify the path the contamination will take. This trace can also be divided into individual line segments by specifying a distance value and units. The line being returned can be the total length of the flow path, a specified maximum trace length, or clipped to area features such as your study area. In many cases, if the total length of the trace path is returned, it will be from the source all the way to the ocean.
