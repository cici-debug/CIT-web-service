																	Merge Layers
																	task copies features from two layers into a new layer. The layers to be merged must all contain the same feature types (points, lines, or polygons). You can control how the fields from the input layers are joined and copied. For example:
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:ul
																Element:li
																	I have three layers for England, Wales, and Scotland and I want a single layer of Great Britain.
																Element:li
																	I have two layers containing parcel information for contiguous townships. I want to join them together into a single layer, keeping only the fields that have the same name and type on the two layers.

								a feature collection.

							Element:p
								(Required)
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The point, line, or polygon features to merge with the

								inputLayer
								. The
							Element:span
								mergeLayer
								must contain the same feature type (point, line, or polygon) as the
							Element:span

								.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Syntax
								: As described in detail in the
							Element:a

								a URL to a feature service layer with an optional filter to select specific features, or
							Element:li

								{"layerDefinition": {}, "featureSet": {}, "filter": <where clause>}
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								mergingAttributes
							Element:td
							Element:p
								An array of values that describe how fields from the
							Element:span
								mergeLayer
								are to be modified. By default, all fields from both inputs will be carried across to the output
							Element:span
								mergedLayer
								.
							Element:p
								If a field exists in one layer but not the other, the output
							Element:span
								mergedLayer
								will contain both fields. The output field will contain null values for the input features that did not have the field. For example, if the
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								contains a field named
							Element:span
								TYPE
								but the
							Element:span
								mergeLayer
								does not contain
							Element:span
								TYPE
								, the output will contain
							Element:span
								TYPE
								, but its values will be null for all the features copied from the
							Element:span
								mergeLayer
								.
							Element:p
								You can control how fields on the
							Element:span
								mergeLayer
								are written to the output as follows:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span
								Remove
								—The field on the
							Element:span
								mergeLayer
								will be removed from the output
							Element:span
								mergedLayer
								.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								Rename
								—The field on the
							Element:span
								mergeLayer
								will be renamed on the output. You cannot rename a field on the
							Element:span
								mergeLayer
								to a field on the
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								. If you want to make field names equivalent, use
							Element:span
								Match
								.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								Match
								—A field on the
							Element:span
								mergeLayer
								is made equivalent to a field on the
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								. For example, the
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								has a field named
							Element:span
								CODE
								and the
							Element:span
								mergeLayer
								has a field named
							Element:span
								STATUS
								. You can match
							Element:span
								STATUS
								to
							Element:span
								CODE
								, and the output will contain the
							Element:span
								CODE
								field with values of the
							Element:span
								STATUS
								field used for features copied from the
							Element:span
								mergeLayer
								. Type casting is supported (for example, double to integer, integer to string) except for string to numeric.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Example:
							Element:ul
								This example performs the following:
							Element:li
							Element:span
								['Temp Remove', 'RiskRate Rename RiskRateJan', 'AirQualityIndex Match AQI']
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								The field named
							Element:span
								Temp
								on the
							Element:span
								mergeLayer
								will not appear in the output (removed from the output).
							Element:li
								The field named
							Element:span
								RiskRate
								on the
							Element:span
								mergeLayer
								will be renamed to
							Element:span
								RiskRateJan
								on the output.
							Element:span
								RiskRateJan
								will contain null values for features copied from the
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								.
							Element:li
								The field named
							Element:span
								AirQualityIndex
								on the
							Element:span
								mergeLayer
								will be matched to the field
							Element:span
								AQI
								on the
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								. The output will contain the field
							Element:span
								AQI
								, and the values of this field will be copied from
							Element:span
								AirQualityIndex
								for those features copied from the
							Element:span
								mergeLayer
								.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span

								If provided, the task will create a feature service of the results. You define the name of the service. If

								is not supplied, the task will return a feature collection.
