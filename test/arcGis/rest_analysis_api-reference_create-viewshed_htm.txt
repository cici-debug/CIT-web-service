								demResolution
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The approximate spatial resolution (cell size) of the source elevation data used for the calculation. The default is the finest resoluton available. The resolution values are an approximation of the spatial resolution of the digital elevation model.

							Element:td
							Element:p
								This is a cutoff distance where the computation of visible areas stops. Beyond this distance, it is unknown whether the analysis points and the other objects can see each other. This is useful for modeling current weather conditions or a given time of day, such as dusk. Large values increase computation time.
							Element:p
								Unless specified, a default maximum distance will be computed based on the resolution and extent of the source DEM. The allowed maximum value is 50 kilometers.

							Element:p
							Element:ul

								If your input points represent wind turbines and you want to determine where people standing on the ground can see the turbines, enter the average height of a person (approximately 6 feet). The result is those areas where a person standing on the ground can see the wind turbines.
							Element:li
								If your input points represent fire lookout towers and you want to determine which lookout towers can see a smoke plume 20 feet high or higher, enter 20 feet for the height. The result is those areas where a fire lookout tower can see a smoke plume at least 20 feet high.
							Element:li
								If your input points represent scenic overlooks along roads and trails and you want to determine where wind turbines 400 feet high or higher can be seen, enter 400 feet for the height. The result is those areas where a person standing at a scenic overlook can see a wind turbine at least 400 feet high.
							Element:li
								If your input points represent scenic overlooks and you want to determine how much area on the ground people standing at the overlook can see, enter zero. The result is those areas that can be seen from the scenic overlook.

								generalize
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Determines whether or not the viewshed polygons are to be generalized. The default value is True.
							Element:p
								The viewshed calculation is based on a raster elevation model that creates a result with stair-stepped edges. To create a more pleasing appearance and improve performance, the default behavior is to generalize the polygons. The generalization process smooths the boundary of the visible areas and may remove some single-cell visible areas.
