																	The
																Element:b
																	Watershed
																	task determines the watershed, or upstream contributing area, for each point in your analysis layer. For example, suppose you have point features representing locations of waterborne contamination, and you want to find the likely sources of the contamination. Since the source of the contamination must be somewhere within the watershed upstream of the point, you would use this tool to define the watersheds containing the sources of the contaminant.

								inputLayer
							Element:p
								(Required)
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The point features used for calculating watersheds. These are referred to as pour points, because it is the location at which water pours out of the watershed.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Syntax
								: As described in detail in the
							Element:a
								Feature Input
								topic, this parameter can be
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								a URL to a feature service layer with an optional filter to select specific features, or
							Element:li
								a feature collection.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Examples
								:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span

							Element:span
								{"layerDefinition": {}, "featureSet": {}, "filter": <where clause>}
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								searchDistance
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The maximum distance to move the location of an input point.
							Element:p
								Use
							Element:span
								searchUnits
								to set the units for
							Element:span
								searchDistance
								.
							Element:p
								If your input points are located away from a drainage line, the resulting watersheds are likely to be very small and not of much use in determining the upstream source of contamination. In most cases, you want your input points to snap to the nearest drainage line in order to find the watersheds that flows to a point located on the drainage line. To find the closest drainage line, specify a search distance. If you do not specify a search distance, the tool will compute and use a conservative search distance.
							Element:p
								To use the exact location of your input point, specify a search distance of zero.
							Element:p
								For analysis purposes, drainage lines have been precomputed by Esri using standard hydrologic models. If there is no drainage line within the search distance, the location containing the highest flow accumulation within the search distance is used.
