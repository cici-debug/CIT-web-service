							Element:td
							Element:p
								If

								True
								, a polygon layer of standard errors for the interpolation predictions will be returned in the
							Element:span
								predictionError
								output parameter.
							Element:p
								Standard errors are useful because they provide information about the reliability of the predicted values. A simple rule of thumb is that the true value will fall within two standard errors of the predicted value 95 percent of the time. For example, suppose a new location gets a predicted value of 50 with a standard error of 5. This means that this task's best guess is that the true value at that location is 50, but it reasonably could be as low as 40 or as high as 60. To calculate this range of reasonable values, multiply the standard error by 2, add this value to the predicted value to get the upper end of the range, and subtract it from the predicted value to get the lower end of the range.

								Determines how predicted values will be classified into areas:

							Element:span
								EqualArea
								—Polygons are created such that the number of data values in each area is equal. For example, if the data has more large values than small values, more areas will be created for large values.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								EqualInterval
								—Polygons are created such that the range of predicted values is equal for each area.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								GeometricInterval
								—Polygons are based on class intervals that have a geometrical series. This method ensures that each class range has approximately the same number of values within each class and that the change between intervals is consistent.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								Manual
								—You to define your own range of values for areas. These values will be entered in the
							Element:span
								classBreaks

							Element:p

								:
							Element:span
								"classificationType": "EqualArea"
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								numClasses
							Element:td
							Element:p
								This value is used to divide the range of interpolated values into distinct classes. The range of values in each class is determined by the
							Element:span
								classificationType
								parameter. Each class defines the boundaries of the result polygons.
							Element:p
								The default is
							Element:span
								10
								. The maximum value is
							Element:span

								.
							Element:p

								:
							Element:span

								classBreaks
							Element:td
							Element:p
								If

								classificationType
								is

								Manual
								, supply desired class break values as a list. These values define the upper limit of each class, so the number of classes will equal the number of entered values. Areas will not be created for any locations with predicted values above the largest entered break value. You must enter at least two values and no more than 32.

							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								boundingPolygonLayer
							Element:td

							Element:p
								An optional layer specifying point locations to calculate prediction values. This allows you to make predictions at specific locations of interest. For example, if the
