																	The
																Element:b
																	Aggregate Points
																	task works with a layer of point features and a layer of polygon features. It first figures out which points fall within each polygon's area. After determining this point-in-polygon spatial relationship, statistics about all points in the polygon are calculated and assigned to the area. The most basic statistic is the count of the number of points within the polygon, but you can get other statistics as well.
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:p
																	For example, if your points represented coffee shops and each point has a
																Element:span
																	TOTAL_SALES
																	attribute, you can get statistics like the sum of all
																Element:span
																	TOTAL_SALES
																	within the polygon, or the minimum or maximum
																Element:span
																	TOTAL_SALES
																	value, or the standard deviation of all sales within the polygon.

							Element:td
							Element:p
								A list of field names and statistical summary type that you wish to calculate for all points within each polygon. Note that the count of points within each polygon is always returned.
							Element:p

							Element:td
							Element:p
								A field name in the

							Element:p
								You can create statistical groups using an attribute in the analysis layer. For example, if you are aggregating crimes to neighborhood boundaries, you may have an attribute
							Element:span
								Crime_type
								with five different crime types. Each unique crime type forms a group, and the statistics you choose will be calculated for each unique value of
							Element:span
								Crime_type
								. When you choose a grouping attribute, two results are created: the result layer and a related table containing the statistics.

								groupSummary
								output table containing the percentages of each attribute value within each group. If

							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								aggregatedLayer
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								aggregatedLayer
								will always contain polygon features. It may have the same or lesser number of polygon features as the input polygon layer based on the value of
							Element:span
								keepPolygonsWithNoPoints
								.
							Element:p
								The layer will inherit all the attributes of the input polygon layer and will have a
							Element:span
								Point_Count
								attribute which is the number of points that are enclosed by the polygon.
							Element:p
								If a
							Element:span
								summaryFields
								parameter is specified in the task request, the layer will have additional attributes for each requested summary. For example, if you had requested
							Element:p
							Element:span
								"summaryFields" :["Annual_Sales Sum", "Annual_Sales Mean"]
							Element:p
								The result polygon features would have two attributes,
							Element:span
								Sum_Annual_Sales
								and
							Element:span
								Mean_Annual_Sales
								to contain the calculated values.
							Element:i
								Request example:
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{"url": "http://<analysis url>/AggregatePoints/jobs/<jobId>/results/aggregatedLayer"}
							Element:p
								The result has properties for parameter name, data type, and value. The contents of value depends upon the

								outputName
								parameter provided in the initial request.
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								If
							Element:span
								outputName
								was provided,
							Element:span
								value

							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								groupSummary
							Element:td
							Element:p
								If the
							Element:span
								groupByField
								parameter is specified an optional group summary table is created. The group summary table provides the count of points and other summary fields for each group of points for each polygon boundaries in the polygon layer. Tables are simply a subset of features; that is, they contain attributes but no geometry.
							Element:p
								The output table will have the following fields:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span
								Join_ID
								—the object ID of the input
							Element:span
								polygonLayer
								.
							Element:li
								The
							Element:span
								groupByField
								.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								Point_Count_<groupByField name>
								—the count of points within the group.
							Element:li
								Fields based on the
							Element:span
								summaryFields
								parameter in the task request. The summary attribute name will be of type
							Element:span
								<summary type>_<fieldname>
								. For example, if you specified
							Element:span
								"summaryFields": ["Annual_Sales Max"]
								in the task request a corresponding
							Element:span
								Max_Annual_Sales
								attribute will be included in the table to present the maximum annual sales for each group in each polygon area.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Request example
								:
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{"url": "http://<analysis url>/AggregatePoints/jobs/<jobId>/results/groupSummary "}
							Element:p
								The result has properties for parameter name, data type, and value. The contents of value depends upon the
							Element:span
								outputName
								parameter provided in the initial request.
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								If
							Element:span
								outputName
								was provided,
							Element:span
