																	Facilities might be public institutions that offer a service, such as fire stations, schools, or libraries, or they might be commercial ones such as drug stores or distribution centers for a parcel delivery service. Demand represents the need for a service that the facilities can meet. Demand is associated with point locations, with each location representing a given amount of demand.

								Travel modes are managed in ArcGIS Online and can be configured by the administrator of your organization to better reflect your organization's workflows. You need to specify the JSON object containing the settings for a travel mode supported by your organization. To get a list of supported travel modes, execute the
							Element:span
								GetTravelModes
								tool from the
							Element:a
								Utilities service
								.
							Element:p
								The value for the
							Element:span
								travelMode
								parameter should be a JSON object representing travel mode settings. When you use the
							Element:span
								GetTravelModes
								tool from the Utilities service, You get a string representing the travel mode JSON. You need to convert this string to a valid JSON object using your API and then pass the JSON object as the value for the
							Element:span
								travelMode
								parameter.
							Element:p
								For example, below is a string representing the Walking Time travel mode as returned by the
							Element:span
								GetTravelModes
								tool.
							Element:pre

								Specify whether travel times should consider traffic conditions. To use traffic in the analysis, To use traffic in the analysis, set
							Element:span
								travelMode
								to a travel mode object whose
							Element:span
								impedanceAttributeName
								property is set to
							Element:span
								TravelTime
								and assign a value to
							Element:span
								timeOfDay
								. (A travel mode with other
							Element:span
								impedanceAttributeName
								values don't support traffic.). The
							Element:span
								timeOfDay
								value represents the time at which travel begins, or departs, from the input points. The time is specified as Unix time (milliseconds since midnight, January 1 1970).
							Element:p
								The service supports two kinds of traffic: typical and live. Typical traffic references travel speeds that are made up of historical averages for each five-minute interval spanning a week. Live traffic retrieves speeds from a traffic feed that processes phone probe records, sensors, and other data sources to record actual travel speeds and predict speeds for the near future.
							Element:p
								The
							Element:a
								Data Coverage page
								shows the countries Esri currently provides traffic data for.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Typical Traffic
								:
							Element:p
								To ensure the task uses typical traffic in locations where it is available, choose a time and day of the week, and then convert the day of the week to one of the following dates from 1990:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Monday—1/1/1990
							Element:li
								Tuesday—1/2/1990

								Friday—1/5/1990
							Element:li
								Saturday—1/6/1990
							Element:li
								Sunday—1/7/1990
							Element:p
								Set the time and date as Unix time in milliseconds.
							Element:p
								For example, to solve for 1:03 p.m. on Thursdays, set the time and date to 1:03 p.m., 4 January 1990; and convert to milliseconds (631458180000).
							Element:p
							Element:h5
								Note:
							Element:p
								Although the dates representing days of the week are from 1990, typical traffic is calculated from recent traffic trends—usually over the last several months.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Live Traffic
								:
							Element:p
								To use live traffic when and where it is available, choose a time and date and convert to Unix time.
							Element:p
								Esri saves live traffic data for

								12
								hours into the future. If the time and date you specify for this parameter is outside the
							Element:span
								24
								-hour time window, or the travel time in the analysis continues past the predictive data window, the task falls back to typical traffic speeds.
