								Tasks in the Spatial Analysis service execute asynchronously, meaning that you submit a request (or job) and then poll the service for status. When the status is
							Element:span
								esriJobSucceeded
								, you then access the results of the task. When you submit a request, the Spatial Analysis service returns to you a unique job ID for the transaction.
