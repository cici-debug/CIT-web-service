					Tasks that have the
				Element:span
					extent
					property in their
				Element:span
					context
					parameter will only process features that overlap the specified extent. The output features will have an extent that is the same or larger than the
				Element:span
					extent
					, as illustrated below.

					"extent": { "xmin": <minimum x-coordinate> "ymin": <minimum y-coordinate> "xmax": <maximum x-coordinate> "ymax": <maximum y-coordinate> "spatialReference": {"wkid": <spatial reference well-known identifier>} }

					Extent example:
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					"extent": { "xmin": -122.68, "ymin": 45.53, "xmax": -122.45, "ymax": 45.6, "spatialReference": { "wkid": 4326 } }

				Element:p
				Element:span
					extent
					is useful when you need to process only a portion of a larger dataset. You can think of this setting as a rectangle used to select input features for processing. Any feature that overlaps the rectangle defined by the extent will be processed and written to output. Note that the rectangle is used only to select features, not clip them. The extent of the output dataset will typically be larger than the
				Element:span
					extent
					setting to account for features that overlap the extent rectangle.

																	It is recommended that you always set the
																Element:span
																	extent
																	to the area you are analyzing. Doing so limits the number of features the task needs to examine when performing analysis, as well as limiting the number of credits used by the task. If you do not set
																Element:span
																	extent
																	, all features in the input layer(s) will potentially be analyzed, and credits used by the task will be based on the number of features in the input layer(s).
