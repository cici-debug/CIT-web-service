								JoinOneToOne
								—If multiple join features are found that have the same relationships with a single target feature, the attributes from the multiple join features will be aggregated using the specified summary statistics. For example, if a point target feature is found within two separate polygon join features, the attributes from the two polygons will be aggregated before being transferred to the output point feature class. If one polygon has an attribute value of 3 and the other has a value of 7, and a
							Element:span
								SummaryField
								of
							Element:span
								sum
								is selected, the aggregated value in the output feature class will be 10. There will always be a
							Element:span
								Count
								field calculated, with a value of 2, for the number of features specified. This is the default.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								JoinOneToMany
								—If multiple join features are found that have the same relationship with a single target feature, the output feature class will contain multiple copies (records) of the target feature. For example, if a single point target feature is found within two separate polygon join features, the output feature class will contain two copies of the target feature: one record with the attributes of the first polygon, and another record with the attributes of the second polygon. There are no summary statistics calculated with this method.

							Element:span
								outputLayer
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The
							Element:span
								outputLayer
								will have the same geometry as the
							Element:span
								targetLayer
								.
							Element:p
								The
							Element:span
								targetLayer
								will inherit all the attributes of the joined
							Element:span
								joinLayer
								. If a
							Element:span
								JoinOneToOne
								was applied, the
							Element:span
								output
								will have a
							Element:span
								Count
								attribute, which is the number of features that matched the join conditions. If a
							Element:span
								summaryFields
								parameter is specified in the task request, the layer will have additional attributes for each requested summary. For example, if you had requested:
							Element:p
							Element:span
								[{"statisticType":"SUM","onStatisticField":"Total_Sales"},{"statisticType":"MEAN","onStatisticField":"Total_Sales"}]
							Element:p
								The result polygon features would have two attributes,
							Element:span
								Sum_Total_Sales
								and
							Element:span
								Mean_Total_Sales
								, to contain the calculated values.
							Element:p
								If a
							Element:span
								JoinOneToMany
								was applied, the
							Element:span
								output
								will have each pair of joined features.
							Element:p
							Element:p
								Example:
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{"url": "http://<analysis url>/JoinFeatures/jobs/<jobId>/results/outputLayer"}
							Element:p
								The result has properties for parameter name, data type, and value. The contents of
							Element:span
								value
								depend on the
							Element:span
								OutputName
								parameter provided in the initial request.
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								If
							Element:span
								OutputName
								was provided,
							Element:span
								value
								contains the URL to the feature service layer.
							Element:p

							Element:li
								If

								value
								contains a feature collection.
