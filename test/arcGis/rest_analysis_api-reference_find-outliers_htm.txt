																	The result map layer shows high outliers in red and low outliers in dark blue. Clusters of high values appear pink and clusters of low values appear light blue. Features that are beige are not a statistically significant outlier and not part of a statistically significant cluster; the spatial pattern associated with these features could very likely be the result of random processes and random chance.

							Element:td
							Element:p
								The result of Find Outliers is a feature layer that provides information about statistically significant outlier features.
							Element:p
								If the input analysis layer (
							Element:span
								analysisLayer
								) contains points and an
							Element:span
								analysisField
								is specified, the result will be points. For all other scenarios (polygons or points when no
							Element:span
								analysisField
								is specified) the output is polygons.
							Element:p
								The result layer has the following attributes:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								an ID field (
							Element:span
								FID
								)—An Integer field with a unique value for every feature.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								AnalysisField
								or
							Element:span
								Join_Count
								—When an
							Element:span
								analysisField
								is specified, it will be copied to the result with the same name and properties. When no
							Element:span
								analysisField
								is specified, an Integer field is created with values reflecting the number of points in each aggregation polygon. If an
							Element:span
								aggregationPolygonLayer
								is specified, these polygons are used for aggregation. Otherwise, a fishnet or hexagon polygon mesh is created to overlay the points, and the squares in the fishnet mesh are used as aggregation polygons.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								Hot/Cold Intensity
								—a numeric (double) field with standard deviations representing the intensity of spatial clustering.
							Element:li
							Element:span
								Confidence Bin
								—use this field for symbolizing the results. Values range from -3 to +3 and reflect statistical significance. Use blue to draw values less than zero and red to draw values greater than zero. Use the darkest blue for features equal to -3, medium blue for -2, and light blue for -1. Use the darkest red for features equal to 3, medium red for 2, and the lightest red or pink for 1. A confidence bin value of zero means no statistically significant clustering, and these features should be drawn in white or beige (the color selected should be neutral and not draw attention at all).
							Element:i
								Example:
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{"url": "http://<analysis url>/FindOutliers/jobs/<jobId>/results/outlierResultLayer"}

								parameter provided in the initial request.

								If

						Node:

							Element:p
								The
							Element:span
								Find Outliers
								task calculates the Anselin Local Moran's I statistic for each feature in a feature layer. The service works by looking at each feature within the context of all features and also looking at each feature within the context of its neighboring features. To be a statistically significant outlier, a feature will have a high value or incident count and will be surrounded by features with low values or incident counts. To be a statistically significant cluster, a feature will have a high value or incident count and will be surrounded by other features with high values or incident counts. The local sum for a feature's neighbors is compared proportionally to the sum of all features, and the feature is also compared to its neighbors; when the local sum is very different from the expected local sum, or the feature's value is very different from the expected value, and when that difference is too large to be the result of random chance, a statistically significant

											Outlier analysis considerations
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											There are three things to consider when undertaking any outlier analysis:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											What is the Analysis Field?
										Element:p
											The Find Outliers analysis tool assesses whether high or low values (the number of crimes, accident severity, or dollars spent on sporting goods, for example) cluster spatially. The field containing those values is your Analysis Field. When the Analysis Layer represents incident points and you are only interested in locating high and low incident densities, select NO ANALYSIS FIELD. When you select NO ANALYSIS FIELD. the Find Outliers service will overlay the incidents points with a fishnet or hexagon and count the number of incidents within each fishnet or hexagon cell. The incident count values will then be used as the Analysis Field.
										Element:li
											What is the question?
										Element:p
											This may seem obvious, but how you construct the Analysis Field determines the types of questions you can answer. Are you most interested in determining where you have lots of incidents or where high/low values for a particular attribute cluster spatially? If so, run the Find Outliers service on the raw values or raw incident counts. This type of analysis is particularly helpful for resource allocation types of problems. Alternatively (or in addition), you may be interested in locating areas with unexpectedly high values in relation to some other variable. If you are analyzing foreclosures, for example, you probably expect more foreclosures in locations with more homes (said another way, at some level, you expect the number of foreclosures to be a function of the number of houses). For each Analysis Layer area, divide the number of foreclosures by the number of homes, then run the Find Outliers service on this ratio. For this analysis, you are no longer asking Where are there unusually low foreclosures?; instead, you are asking Where are there unexpectedly low numbers of foreclosures, given the number of homes? By creating a rate or ratio prior to analysis, you can control for certain expected relationships (for example, the number of crimes is a function of population; the number of foreclosures is a function of housing stock) and will then be identifying unexpected outlier areas.
										Element:li
											Does the analysis layer contain at least 30 features?
										Element:p
											Results aren't reliable with less than 30 features.
