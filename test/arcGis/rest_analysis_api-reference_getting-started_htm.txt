																	The Spatial Analysis service contains a number of tasks that allow you to perform common spatial analyses on your hosted data.
																	An overview of the available tasks can be found in
																Element:a
																	Overview of tasks contained in the Spatial Analysis service
																	.
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:p
																	These tasks are also available as tools in the ArcGIS.com map viewer. These tools allow end-users to easily perform analysis against layers hosted in Online as well as other layers they have access to. To learn more about accessing these tasks using the ArcGIS.com map viewer, see the ArcGIS.com help topic
																Element:a
																	Perform analysis
																	. Note that in some cases, the Spatial Analysis REST API has more functionality that is not exposed in the ArcGIS.com map viewer.

						Node:

								In order to use the analysis tasks, the administrator of your organization needs to grant you certain
							Element:a
								privileges
								. To use any of the analysis tools, you will need the
							Element:span
								Spatial Analysis
								privilege. If the output of your task is a hosted feature service, as opposed to a feature collection, you also need the two following privileges:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span
								Create, update, and delete
								content
							Element:li
							Element:span
								Publish hosted features
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Certain tasks need additional privileges such as
							Element:span
								Network Analysis
								and
							Element:span
								GeoEnrichment
								. If the task requires additional privileges, they will be listed in the task documentation.

								The tasks in the Spatial Analysis service all share a common pattern.

								One or more of their input parameters are features. These features can come from a feature service, map service, or in the form of a feature collection. See
							Element:a
								Feature Input
								for more information.
							Element:li
								As described in
							Element:a
								Feature Output
								, all the spatial analysis tasks create new data. How data is returned to you is controlled by the
							Element:span
								outputName
								parameter.
							Element:li
								All tasks have a
							Element:span
								context
								parameter which controls certain aspects of task execution.
							Element:span
								context
								has two properties;
							Element:a
								Extent
								and
							Element:a
								Spatial Reference
								.
							Element:li
								All tasks execute asynchronously. That is, when you submit a request, you are handed back a job identifier which you can use to track progress and retrieve results. See
							Element:a
								Checking job status
								for more information.
