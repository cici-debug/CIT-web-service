								As described in the

								The features to enrich with new data.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Syntax
								: As described in detail in the
							Element:a
								Feature Input
								topic, this parameter can be
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								a URL to a feature service layer with an optional filter to select specific features, or
							Element:li
								a feature collection.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Examples
								:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span
								{"url": <feature service layer url>, "filter": <where clause>}
							Element:li
							Element:span
								{"layerDefinition": {}, "featureSet": {}, "filter": <where clause>}
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								dataCollections
							Element:p
							Element:td
							Element:p
								This optional parameter defines the collections of data you want to use to enrich your features. Its value is a list of strings. If you don't provide this parameter, you must provide the
							Element:span
								analysisVariables
								parameter.
							Element:p
								For more information about data collections and the values for this parameter, visit the
							Element:a
								Esri Demographics site
								.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Example:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span
								"dataCollections": ["KeyGlobalFacts", "KeyUSFacts"]
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								analysisVariables
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The parameter defines the specific variables within a data collection you want to use to enrich your features. Its value is a list of strings in the form of "dataCollection.VariableName". If you don't provide this parameter, you must provide the
							Element:span
								dataCollections
								parameter. You can provide both parameters. For example, if you want all variables in the KeyGlobalFacts data collection, specify it in the
							Element:span
								dataCollections
								parameter and use this parameter for specific variables in other collections.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Example:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span
								"analysisVariables": ["KeyGlobalFacts.AVGHHSIZE", "KeyUSFacts.TOTPOP10", "KeyUSFacts.HINC100_CY_P"]
							Element:p
								For more information about variables in data collections, visit the
							Element:a
								Esri Demographics site
								. Each data collection has a PDF file describing variables and their names.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								country
							Element:td
							Element:p
								This optional parameter further defines what is returned from data collection. For example, your input features may be countries in Western Europe, and you want to enrich them with the
							Element:span
								KeyWEFacts
								data collection. However, you only want data for France, not every country in your input layer. The value is the two-character country code.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Example:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span
								"country": "FR"
							Element:p
								For more information about data collections and the values for this parameter, visit the
							Element:a
								Esri Demographics site
								.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								bufferType
							Element:p
								(Required if
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								contains point or line features)
							Element:td
							Element:p
								If your input features are points or lines, you must define an area around your features that you want to enrich. Features that are within (or equal to) the distances you enter will be enriched. You can specify either straight-line distance or a travel mode.
							Element:p
								Valid values are a string,
							Element:span
								StraightLine
								, which indicates Euclidean distance to be used as distance measure or a JSON object representing settings for a travel mode.
							Element:p
								Travel modes are managed in ArcGIS Online and can be configured by the administrator of your organization to better reflect your organization's workflows. You need to specify the JSON object containing the settings for a travel mode supported by your organization. To get a list of supported travel modes, execute the
							Element:span
								GetTravelModes
								tool from the
							Element:a
								Utilities service
								.
							Element:p
								When using a travel mode for the
							Element:span
								bufferType
								, the value should be a JSON object representing travel mode settings. When you use the
							Element:span
								GetTravelModes
								tool from the Utilities service, You get a string representing the travel mode JSON. You need to convert this string to a valid JSON object using your API and then pass the JSON object as the value for the
							Element:span
								bufferType
								parameter.
							Element:p
								For example, below is a string representing the Walking Time travel mode as returned by the
							Element:span
								GetTravelModes
								tool.
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								"{\"attributeParameterValues\": [{\"parameterName\": \"Restriction Usage\", \"attributeName\": \"Walking\", \"value\": \"PROHIBITED\"}, {\"parameterName\": \"Restriction Usage\", \"attributeName\": \"Preferred for Pedestrians\", \"value\": \"PREFER_LOW\"}, {\"parameterName\": \"Walking Speed (km/h)\", \"attributeName\": \"WalkTime\", \"value\": 5}], \"description\": \"Follows paths and roads that allow pedestrian traffic and finds solutions that optimize travel time.

							Element:p
								The above value should be converted to a valid JSON object and passed as the value for the
							Element:span
								bufferType
								parameter
							Element:p
							Element:span
								bufferType=
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "attributeParameterValues": [ { "parameterName": "Restriction Usage", "attributeName": "Walking", "value": "PROHIBITED" }, { "parameterName": "Restriction Usage", "attributeName": "Preferred for Pedestrians", "value": "PREFER_LOW" }, { "parameterName": "Walking Speed (km\/h)", "attributeName": "WalkTime", "value": 5 } ], "description": "Follows paths and roads that allow pedestrian traffic and finds solutions that optimize travel time.

							Element:p
								(Required if

								of 5 miles, your result will contain areas with a 5 mile radius around the input features and requested
