																	The

																	Find Similar Locations
																	task measures the similarity of candidate locations to one or more reference locations.
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:p
																	Based on criteria you specify,
																Element:b
																	Find Similar Locations
																	can answer questions such as the following:
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:ul
																Element:li
																	Which of your stores are most similar to your top performers with regard to customer profiles?
																Element:li
																	Based on characteristics of villages hardest hit by the disease, which other villages are high risk?
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:p
																	To answer questions such as these, you provide the reference locations (the
																Element:span
																	inputLayer
																	parameter), the candidate locations (the
																Element:span
																	searchLayer
																	parameter), and the fields representing the criteria you want to match. For example, the
																Element:span
																	inputLayer
																	might be a layer containing your top performing stores or the villages hardest hit by the disease. The
																Element:span
																	searchLayer
																	contains your candidate locations to search. This might be all of your stores or all other villages. Finally, you supply a list of fields to use for measuring similarity.
																Element:b
																	Find Similar Locations
																	will rank all of the candidate locations by how closely they match your reference locations across all of the fields you have selected.

								Description
							Element:tbody
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								inputLayer
							Element:p
								(Required)
							Element:td
							Element:p
								The
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								contains one or more reference locations against which features in the
							Element:span
								searchLayer
								will be evaluated for similarity. For example, the
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								might contain your top performing stores or the villages hardest hit by a disease.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Syntax
								: As described in detail in the
							Element:a
								Feature Input
								topic, this parameter can be
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								a URL to a feature service layer with an optional filter to select specific features, or
							Element:li
								a feature collection.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Examples
								:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span
								{"url": <feature service layer url>, "filter": <where clause>}
							Element:li
							Element:span
								{"layerDefinition": {}, "featureSet": {}, "filter": <where clause>}
							Element:p
								It is not uncommon that the
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								and
							Element:span
								searchLayer
								are the same feature service. For example, the feature service contains locations of all stores, one of which is your top performing store. If you want to rank the remaining stores from most to least similar to your top performing store, you can provide a filter for both the
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								and the
							Element:span
								searchLayer
								. The filter on the
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								would select the top performing store while the filter on the
							Element:span
								searchLayer
								would select all stores except for the top performing store. You can also use the optional
							Element:span
								inputQuery
								parameter to specify reference locations.
							Element:p
								If there is more than one reference location, similarity will be based on averages for the fields you specify in the
							Element:span
								analysisFields
								parameter. So, for example, if there are two reference locations and you are interested in matching population, the task will look for candidate locations in the
							Element:span
								searchLayer
								with populations that are most like the average population for both reference locations. If the values for the reference locations are 100 and 102, for example, the task will look for candidate locations with populations near 101. Consequently, you will want to use fields for the reference locations fields that have similar values. If, for example, the population values for one reference location is 100 and the other is 100,000, the tool will look for candidate locations with population values near the average of those two values: 50,050. Notice that this averaged value is nothing like the population for either of the reference locations.

							Element:span

							Element:p
								(Required)
							Element:td
							Element:p
								A list of fields whose values are used to determine similarity. They must be numeric fields and the fields must exist on both the
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								and the
							Element:span
								searchLayer
								. The task will find features in the
							Element:span
								searchLayer
								that have field values closest to those of the features in your
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Examples:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span
								"analysisFields":["value"]
								(single analysis field)
							Element:li

								inputQuery
							Element:td
							Element:p
								In the situation where the

								inputLayer
								and the
							Element:span
								searchLayer
								are the same feature service, this parameter allows you to input a query on the
							Element:span
								inputLayer
								to specify which features are the reference locations. The reference locations specified by this query will not be analyzed as candidates. The syntax of
							Element:span
								inputQuery
								is the same as a filter.
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Examples:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span
								"inputQuery":"age_10_14 = 1"]
								(for numeric field)

								"inputQuery":"color = 'Green'"]
