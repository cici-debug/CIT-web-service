					The Spatial Analysis service contains a number of tasks that you can access and use in your applications.
				Element:span
					These tasks are arranged below into categories; the categories match those that appear in Perform Analysis sidebar in the ArcGIS.com map viewer application
					. The categories are simply logical groupings and do not affect how you access or use the tasks in any way.

																	The
																Element:b
																	Aggregate Points
																	task works with a layer of point features and a layer of polygon features. It first figures out which points fall within each polygon's area. After determining this point-in-polygon spatial relationship, statistics about all points in the polygon are calculated and assigned to the area. The most basic statistic is the count of the number of points within the polygon, but you can get other statistics as well.

																	The

																	task finds features that are within a specified distance of features in the input layer. Distance can be measured as a straight-line distance or by a specified travel mode. Statistics are then calculated for the nearby features. For example:
																Element:ul
																Element:li
																	Calculate the total population within five minutes of driving time of a proposed new store location.
																Element:li
																	Calculate the number of freeway access ramps within a one-mile driving distance of a proposed new store location to use as a measure of store accessibility.

																Element:ul
																Element:li
																	Given a layer of watershed boundaries and a layer of land-use boundaries by land-use type, calculate total acreage of land-use type for each watershed.
																Element:li
																	Given a layer of parcels in a county and a layer of city boundaries, summarize the average value of vacant parcels within each city boundary.

An example of an attribute expression is that a parcel must be vacant, which is an attribute of the Parcels layer (

																Element:p
																	Facilities might be public institutions that offer a service, such as fire stations, schools, or libraries, or they might be commercial ones such as drug stores or distribution centers for a parcel delivery service. Demand represents the need for a service that the facilities can meet. Demand is associated with point locations, with each location representing a given amount of demand.

																	task determines the watershed, or upstream contributing area, for each point in your analysis layer. For example, suppose you have point features representing locations of waterborne contamination, and you want to find the likely sources of the contamination. Since the source of the contamination must be somewhere within the watershed upstream of the point, you would use this tool to define the watersheds containing the sources of the contaminant.

It finds statistically significant spatial clusters of high values (hot spots) and low values (cold spots). For point data when no field is specified, hot spots are locations with lots of points and cold spots are locations with very few points.

																Element:ul
																Element:li
																	An air quality management district has sensors that measure pollution levels. Interpolate Points can be used to predict pollution levels at locations that don't have sensors, such as locations with at-risk populations—schools or hospitals, for example.
																Element:li

																Element:li
																	Predict soil nutrient levels (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and so on) and other indicators (such as electrical conductivity) in order to study their relationships to crop yield and prescribe precise amounts of fertilizer for each location in the field.

																	task creates polygons that cover a given distance from a point, line, or polygon feature. Buffers are typically used to create areas that can be further analyzed using a tool such as Overlay Layers. For example, if the question is "What buildings are within one mile of the school?", the answer can be found by creating a one-mile buffer around the school and overlaying the buffer with the layer containing building footprints. The end result is a layer of those buildings within one mile of the school.

																	The
																Element:b
																	Find Nearest
																	task measures the straight-line distance, driving distance, or driving time from features in the analysis layer to features in the near layer, and copies the nearest features in the near layer to a new layer. Connecting lines showing the measured path are returned as well. Find Nearest also reports the measurement and relative rank of each nearest feature. There are options to limit the number of nearest features to find or the search range in which to find them. The results from this tool can help you answer the following kinds of questions:
																Element:ul
																Element:li
																	What is the nearest park from here?
																Element:li
																	Which hospital can I reach in the shortest drive time? And how long would the trip take on a Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. during rush hour?
																Element:li
																	What are the road distances between major European cities?
																Element:li
																	Which of these patients reside within two miles of these chemical plants?

																	Merge Layers
																	task copies features from two layers into a new layer. The layers to be merged must all contain the same feature types (points, lines, or polygons). You can control how the fields from the input layers are joined and copied. For example:
																Element:ul
																Element:li
																	I have three layers for England, Wales, and Scotland and I want a single layer of Great Britain.
																Element:li
																	I have two layers containing parcel information for contiguous townships. I want to join them together into a single layer, keeping only the fields that have the same name and type on the two layers.

																	Overlay Layers
																Element:td
																Element:p
																Element:img
																Element:p
																	The
																Element:b
																	Overlay Layers
																	task combines two or more layers into one single layer. You can think of overlay as peering through a stack of maps and creating a single map containing all the information found in the stack. In fact, before the advent of GIS, cartographers would literally copy maps onto clear acetate sheets, overlay these sheets on a light table, and hand draw a new map from the overlaid data. Overlay is much more than a merging of line work; all the attributes of the features taking part in the overlay are carried through to the final product. Overlay is used to answer one of the most basic questions of geography, "what is on top of what?" For example:
																Element:ul
																Element:li
																	What parcels are within the 100-year floodplain? (Within is just another way of saying on top of.)
																Element:li
																	What roads are within what counties?
																Element:li
																	What land use is on top of what soil type?
																Element:li
																	What wells are within abandoned military bases?

The expression can use values from other fields. The result of this task is a new layer with all the fields from the input layer as well as any new fields you create. Field values are updated according to the expressions you provide.
