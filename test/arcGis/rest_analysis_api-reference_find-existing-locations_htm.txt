An example of an attribute expression is that a parcel must be vacant, which is an attribute of the Parcels layer (
																Element:span
																	where STATUS = 'VACANT'
																	). An example of a spatial expression is that the parcel must also be within a certain distance of a river (

								LIKE '%<string>'
							Element:td
							Element:p
								A percent symbol (%) signifies a wildcard, meaning that anything is acceptable in its place—one character, a hundred characters, or no character. This expression would select Mississippi and Missouri among USA state names:
							Element:p
							Element:span
								STATE_NAME LIKE 'Miss%'
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								BETWEEN <value1> AND <value2>
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Selects a record if it has a value greater than or equal to <value1> and less than or equal to <value2>. For example, this expression selects all records with an HHSIZE value greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 10:
							Element:p
							Element:span
								HHSIZE BETWEEN 3 AND 10
							Element:p
								The above is equivalent to:
							Element:p
							Element:span
								HHSIZE >= 3 AND HHSIZE <= 10
							Element:p
								This operator applies to numeric or date fields. Here is an example of a date query on the field

								ObsDate
								:
							Element:p
							Element:span
								ObsDate BETWEEN '1998-04-30 00:00:00' AND '1998-04-30 23:59:59'
							Element:p
								Time is optional.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								NOT BETWEEN <value1> AND <value2>
							Element:td
							Element:p
								Selects a record if it has a value outside the range between <value1> and <value2>. For example, this expression selects all records whose HHSIZE value is less than 5 and greater than 7:
							Element:p
							Element:span
								HHSIZE NOT BETWEEN 5 AND 7
							Element:p
								The above is equivalent to:
							Element:p
							Element:span
								HHSIZE < 5 OR HHSIZE > 7
							Element:p
								This operator applies to numeric or date fields.

							Element:i
								Example spatial expression:

								—If a feature in

							Element:li

								to those in

								selectingLayer
								.
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span
								withinDistance
								—A feature in

							Element:li
							Element:span
								notWithinDistance
								—A feature in
							Element:span
								layer
								is excluded (not included in the output) if it is within a distance of a feature in
							Element:span
								selectingLayer
								; for example, parcels within 100 meters of a river will not be included in the output. You can think of this relationship as "is farther away than".
							Element:p
							Element:b
								Note
								:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Distances are calculated between the closest parts of features. For example, if parcels are to be within 0.75 miles of the Los Angeles River, parcels are selected if any part of the parcel is within 0.75 miles. If the criteria is that the entire parcel must be within 0.75 miles, you would use the Create Buffers tool with a distance of 0.75 miles around the Los Angeles River to create a new layer. You would then create an expression where parcels
							Element:span
								within
								the buffer layer.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:span
								contains
							Element:p
							Element:span
								notContains
							Element:td
							Element:p
							Element:figure
							Element:img
							Element:p
								A feature in
							Element:span
								layer
								passes this test if it completely surrounds a feature in
							Element:span
								selectingLayer
								. No portion of the contained feature can be outside the containing feature; however, the contained feature is allowed to touch the containing feature (that is, share a common point along its boundary).
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:span
								contains
								—If a feature in
							Element:span

								contains a feature in
							Element:span

							Element:li
							Element:span
								notContains
								—If a feature in
							Element:span

								contains a feature in
							Element:span
								selectingLayer
								, the feature in the first layer is excluded from the output.
							Element:p
							Element:b
								Note
								:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								You can use the contains relationship with points and lines. For example, you have a layer of street centerlines (lines) and a layer of manhole covers (points), and you want to find streets that contain a manhole cover. You could use
							Element:span
								contains
								to find streets that contain manhole covers, but in order for a line to contain a point, the point must be exactly on the line (that is, in GIS terms, they are snapped to each other). If there is any doubt about this, use the
							Element:span
								withinDistance
								relationship with a suitable distance value.

								—If a feature in

							Element:p
							Element:b
								Note
								:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								You can use the within relationship for points and lines, just as you can with the contains relationship. For example, your first layer contains points representing manhole covers and you want to find the manholes that are on street centerlines (as opposed to parking lots or other non-street features). You could use
							Element:span
								within
								to find manhole points within street centerlines, but in order for a point to contain a line, the point must be exactly on the line (that is, in GIS terms, they are snapped to each other). If there is any doubt about this, use the
							Element:span
								withinDistance
								relationship with a suitable distance value.
							Element:li
							Element:span

								is the distance to use for the
							Element:span
								withinDistance
								and
							Element:span

							Element:p
								An expression may be a list, which denotes a group. The first operator in the group indicates how the group expression is added to the previous expression. Grouping expressions is only necessary when you need to create two or more distinct sets of features from the same layer. One way to think of grouping is that without grouping, you would have to execute Find Existing Locations multiple times and merge the results.
							Element:p
							Element:p
								Following is an example where grouping is needed:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								You have a layer representing places that contain toxic chemicals. Each feature has an attribute, CHEMICAL, containing the name of the toxic chemical known to exist at the site.
							Element:li
								You want to find toxic sites containing Mercury or Selenium that are near a river (layer 0).
							Element:li
								You also want to find toxic sites containing Benzene or Lead that are near a park (layer 1).
							Element:p
							Element:i
								Example of grouping using a list:
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								[ { "operator": "and", "layer": 0, "spatialRel": "withinDistance", "selectingLayer": 1, "distance": 0.5, "units": "Miles" }, [ { "operator": "and", "layer": 0, "where": "CHEMICAL = 'MERCURY'" }, { "operator": "or", "layer": 0, "where": "CHEMICAL = 'SELENIUM'" }, ], [ { "operator": "or", "layer": 0, "spatialRel": "withinDistance", "selectingLayer": 2, "distance": 0.5, "units": "Miles" }, [ { "operator": "and", "layer": 0, "where": "CHEMICAL = 'BENZENE'" }, { "operator": "or", "layer": 0, "where": "CHEMICAL = 'LEAD'" } ] ] ]
