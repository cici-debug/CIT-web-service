								Introduction to Service
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The Business Policies Management API is a SOA service that is intended to be consumed by sellers who are interested in creating and managing payment, return, and shipping business policies to use with their eBay listings. High-level information for the service are covered below, including service endpoints, HTTP headers and URL parameters, naming conventions, and versioning scheme.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:b
								Service Endpoints
								—The Business Policies Management API has unique gateway URLs (service endpoints) for the Production environment and the Sandbox environment. The service endpoint includes the service version (e.g.,
							Element:code
								v1
								). When updating to a new major version of the service, you must update to a new service endpoint as well.
							Element:li
							Element:b
								The Business Policies Management API
								uses eBay's Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) framework and requires that an eBay authorization token is passed in through a (X-EBAY-SOA-SECURITY-TOKEN) header or (SECURITY-TOKEN ) URL parameter.
							Element:li
							Element:b
								Schema and data type notes
								—The Business Policies Management API does not share schema or data types with other eBay APIs. In the API, you will find the following difference from other eBay APIs:
							Element:br
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								XML namespace is versioned. To prevent type collisions associated with backward incompatible service changes, the XML namespace is versioned. As with the service endpoint, when updating to a new major version of the service, note that the XML namespace will change as well.
							Element:li
							Element:b
								Naming conventions
								—The naming conventions for the Business Policies Management API are slightly different than the Trading API. Most notably, call names and fields in the Business Policies Management API begin with lowercase letters.
							Element:li
							Element:b
								Versioning scheme
								—The version numbering scheme for the Business Policies Management API is different from the scheme used by the eBay Shopping and Trading APIs. The Business Policies Management API version consists of three digits (e.g., 1.2.3):
							Element:br
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								The first digit indicates the
							Element:b
								major release version
								. Major releases are not backward compatible. eBay supports the two most recent major versions of the service. The service endpoints and target namespace include the major version of the service.
							Element:li
								The second digit indicates the
							Element:b
								minor release version
								. Minor releases consist of feature additions or behavior changes that are backward compatible.
							Element:li
								The third digit indicates the
							Element:b
								maintenance
								, or
							Element:b
								micro release version
								. Maintenance releases are used to correct minor problems. Maintenance releases have minimal impact on the features or functionality of the API. These changes may or may not have associated schema changes.

								Each Business Policies Management API call consists of the following elements:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:b
								Service Endpoint
								—Business Policies API requests are sent to the Sandbox endpoint for the Business Policies Management API.
							Element:li
							Element:b
								HTTP Headers or URL Parameters
								—Each Business Policies Management API call requires a
							Element:code
								X-EBAY-SOA-SECURITY-TOKEN
								header or a
							Element:code
								SECURITY-APPNAME
								URL parameter. Similarly, you must always specify the call name in the
							Element:code
								X-EBAY-SOA-OPERATION-NAME
								header or
							Element:code
								OPERATION-NAME
								URL parameter. Other headers are optional or conditionally required.
							Element:li
							Element:b
								Standard Input Fields
								—The
							Element:b
								ExtensionType
								field and its four child elements are the only standard input fields for calls in the Business Policies Management API. These fields are optional.
							Element:li
							Element:b
								Call-specific Fields
								—The input fields that are specific to a particular API call.

										Element:td
											No
										Element:td
											The Business Policies Management API supports XML and SOAP request formats with the HTTP POST method. Input can be in XML or SOAP formats. The default value for HTTP POST requests is XML.
										Element:br
											For SOAP requests, you must specify the protocol version in the
										Element:code
											X-EBAY-SOA-MESSAGE-PROTOCOL
											header. If you use a URL for an HTTP GET request, REQUEST-DATA-FORMAT is unnecessary because the only valid value is NV (Name-Value Pair).
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											X-EBAY-SOA-RESPONSE-DATA-FORMAT
										Element:td
											X-EBAY-SOA-RESPONSE-DATA-FORMAT
										Element:td
											No
										Element:td
											If you use a URL (HTTP GET) request, use this parameter to specify the output format as XML. URL requests do not support SOAP responses. If you use a URL, and you do not specify RESPONSE- DATA-FORMAT, the output format will be XML. If you use the HTTP POST method, the output data (response data) will be in the same format as the input data.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											REST-PAYLOAD
										Element:td
											N/A
										Element:td
											No
										Element:td
											If you use a URL, use this parameter to separate the payload part of the URL from the standard headers. Requires no value; anything appearing after this header will be considered part of the call payload. This parameter is ignored in HTTP POST requests.

											URL Encoding for String Values
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Name-value requests must be constructed using the ASCII character-set only. Most ASCII characters (e.g., the numbers from 0-9 and the uppercase and lowercase English letters from A to Z) can be used as is. Some special characters, however, such as spaces, ampersands ("
										Element:code
											&
											") and quotation marks, must be encoded in URL requests when used in string values for fields.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Special characters that must be URL-encoded include (but are not limited to) characters used in URL request syntax, such as ampersands ("
										Element:code
											&
											"), the equals sign ("
										Element:code
											=
											"), the pound sign ("
										Element:code
											#
											"), the "at" symbol ("
										Element:code
											@
											"), or the percent sign ("
										Element:code
											%
											").
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											URL-encoded characters are in the form %HH, where HH is a hexadecimal number. For example, the URL-encoded value for an ampersand is
										Element:code
											%26
											and the URL-encoded value for a space is
										Element:code
											%20
											. The plus sign ("+") can also be used in place of spaces.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Many languages provide functions or methods to do the URL encoding for you. For example, PHP provides the
										Element:code
											rawurlencode
											function and Java provides
										Element:code
											URLEncoder
											class. For more information about URL encoding, see
