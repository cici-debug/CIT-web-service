					The Business Policies Management API allows sellers to create and manage business policies (payment, return, and shipping). Sellers can easily create these business policies and associate them to an eBay category group. Since every listing on eBay is linked to a category, this API will allow you to create a business policy and immediately apply it all listings for a group of categories. By using the Business Policies Management API, sellers will no longer have to recreate, reassign, and update the same payment, return policy, and shipping settings/values for each individual listing. Managing business policies through this API will help sellers save significant time in creating and updating their listings.
			Node:

				Element:p
					Business Policies are not yet available to all sellers. Once Business Policies become available to a seller, that seller can opt in to Business Policies through the
				Element:strong
					Sell
					section in My eBay. A seller can verify whether or not their account is opted in to Business Policies by making a call to Trading API's
				Element:a
					GetUserPreferences
					, and including the
				Element:strong
					ShowSellerProfilePreferences
					flag in the call request. In the
				Element:strong
					GetUserPreferences
					response, the seller will look for a 'true' value in the
				Element:strong
					SellerProfilePreferences.SellerProfileOptedIn
					field. Regardless of opt-in status, a seller can actually use the Business Policies Management API to create and manage business policies, but that same seller will not be able to access the Business Policies Management UI on the eBay site nor apply specific business policies to listings until the account has been opted-in to Business Policies.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Once a seller is opted in to Business Policies, eBay will automatically extract and create all business policies for the seller's account based on listings created by that seller in the last 90 days. The seller then has the option to tweak (change name, change values, assign to new category groups, etc.) these existing policies or leave as is. A seller can create as many payment, return, and shipping policies as they wish, but there can only be one default business policy for each policy type/category group pair. The seller can manage which policies are used by default through My eBay. A seller can also discover which payment, return, and shipping policies are default by making a call to Trading API's
				Element:a
					GetUserPreferences
					, and including the
				Element:strong
					ShowSellerProfilePreferences
					flag in the call request. In the
				Element:strong
					GetUserPreferences
					response, the seller will look for a 'true' value in the
				Element:strong
					SellerProfilePreferences.SupportedSellerProfiles.SupportedSellerProfile.CategoryGroup.IsDefault
					field. If the seller had a default payment policy for Motor Vehicle listings and a default payment policy for all other listings, you might see the following nodes in the

					Once a seller's account is opted into Business Policies, the payment, return, and shipping options/values set in the default business policies will automatically be set whenever the seller lists an item. It is then at the seller's discretion to modify, delete, or add new settings/values in Web flow or by using an
				Element:b
					addSellerProfile
					or
				Element:b
					setSellerProfile
					call. The seller also has the option of using/referencing another (non-default) business policy (in Web flow or through the
				Element:strong

								Overview of the Service
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The Business Policies Management API is a SOA service that is meant to be consumed by users who want to programmatically create and manage business policies. The API allows you to create payment, return, and shipping business policies. The settings/values captured in these business policies can then be automatically applied to eBay listings.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When a seller lists an item, the Business Policies Management API verifies which Business Policies category group that the item belongs to (based on the eBay category the item is listed under), and then retrieves and applies the default business policies for that Business Policies category group.
							Element:br
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Previous to the concept of business policies, a seller had to specify and update payment, return, and shipping settings/values for each individual listing. This meant that the seller had to enter the same information repeatedly for each listing. With Business Policies, a seller can partially automate (through Web flow or through Trading API's Add/Revise/Relist calls) the process of listing, revising, or relisting an item.

											About Category Groups
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:b
											categoryGroup
											container in Business Policies Management API calls defines a group of eBay categories and connects this category group to a business policy. This allows seller to create one business policy that can be applied to many categories. The relationship between a
										Element:b
											categoryGroup
											container and a business policy is:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											One business policy can be associated with multiple category groups.
										Element:li
											A category group can be associated with many business policies.
										Element:p
											Currently, the valid values for a category group names are 'ALL' (all non- motor vehicle categories) and 'MOTORS_VEHICLE' (all motor vehicle categories). The 'MOTORS_VEHICLE' category group is not valid for return policies, as return policies cannot be used with motor vehicle listings. In the future, there may be other valid values for category group names.
										Element:br
										Element:p
											The first business policy (payment, return, or shipping) that the seller creates (or eBay creates for the seller) for a category group becomes the default policy for that category group and policy type combination. However, you can modify the "default" payment, return, or shipping policy through My eBay or through the
										Element:strong
											setSellerProfile
											call. Only one policy can be set as default for the category group and policy type combination at any given time.

											Creating a Business Policy
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When a seller creates a business policy, the seller provides a name for the policy and eBay assigns a unique ID number (
										Element:b
											profileId
											) to a successfully created policy. Other data that the seller provides for the business policy is the category group(s) to which the business policy will apply, the eBay site where the items will be sold, and all applicable settings/values for buyer payment (for payment policies), return policy details (for return policies), and the shipping details (for shipping policies). Here are the high-level steps for creating a business policy through an
										Element:b
											addSellerProfile
											call:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ol
										Element:li
											Assign a category group to which the business policy will apply by setting the
										Element:b
											categoryGroup.name
											value to 'ALL' or 'MOTORS_VEHICLE'. Optionally, set the assigned category group as default by including and setting the
										Element:b
											categoryGroup.default
											value to 'true'. If the
										Element:b
											categoryGroup.default
											field is included and set to 'true', the business policy (and its settings) will apply to all newly created listings that fall under that category group. However, the seller cannot pass in a
										Element:b
											categoryGroup.default
											value of 'true' if a default business policy already exists for that category group and policy type combination. The 'MOTORS_VEHICLE' category group is not valid for return business policies, as return business policies cannot be used with motor vehicle listings.
										Element:li
											Define the policy type by including the
										Element:b
											profileType
											field and setting its value to 'PAYMENT', 'RETURN_POLICY' or 'SHIPPING'.
										Element:li
											Assign a name to the business policy through the
										Element:b
											profileName
											field. It is a good idea to give the business policy a descriptive name so you can easily identify it. All business policy names should be unique within each policy type (payment, return, shipping).
										Element:li
											Optionally, provide a text description of the business policy through the
										Element:b
											profileDesc
											field.
										Element:li
											Optionally, provide the
										Element:b
											siteId
											value of the listing site. If this field is not provided, the
										Element:b
											siteId
											value defaults to the seller's registration site.
										Element:li
											Specify the details of each policy type that is being created through the
										Element:b
											paymentProfile.paymentInfo
											,
										Element:b
											returnPolicyProfile.returnPolicyInfo
											, and/or
										Element:b
											shippingPolicyProfile.shippingPolicyInfo
											containers.

											Modifying a Business Policy
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To modify an existing business policy, you use the
										Element:b
											setSellerProfile
											call. First, you want to identify the payment, return, or shipping business policy to modify by providing a valid value in the
										Element:b
											profileName
											and/or
										Element:b
											profileId
											field in the request. Then, you can modify any existing value defined for a business policy or add fields to a business policy. For example, you might want to add additional
										Element:b
											acceptedPaymentMethod
											values for a payment business policy, or add a text description of the return policy through the
										Element:b
											returnPolicyInfo.description
											field, or add an additional domestic shipping service through an additional
										Element:b
											domesticShippingPolicyInfoService
											container.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:b
											Note:
											Modifying an existing business policy creates a �clone' of that business policy, and all listings that referenced the previous business policy are reassigned to the new business policy. Active listings that are in restricted revise mode will be assigned to the new business policy, but values/settings will remain unchanged.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Another use case for using the
										Element:b
											setSellerProfile
											call is to change the default business policy for a category group and policy type combination. It would actually require two
										Element:b
											setSellerProfile
											calls to perform this action. In the first call, you'd identify the current default business policy through the
										Element:strong
											profileId
											field, identify the category group that the business policy belongs to in the
										Element:strong
											categoryGroup.name
											field, and then pass in a value of 'false' in the
										Element:strong
											categoryGroup.default
											field. In the second call, you'd identify the business policy that you want set as the new default business policy through the
										Element:strong
											profileId
											field, identify the category group that the business policy belongs to in the
										Element:strong
											categoryGroup.name
											field, and then pass in a value of 'true' in the
										Element:strong
											categoryGroup.default
											field.

											Retrieving Business Policies
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To retrieve one or more business policies, you use the
										Element:b
											getSellerProfiles
											call. The seller has the option of retrieving all existing business policies (no input parameters), specific business policies identified by
										Element:b
											profileId
											and/or
										Element:b
											profileName
											value(s), or business policies matching the specified
										Element:b

											Deleting a Business Policy
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To delete one business policy, you use the
										Element:b
											removeProfile
											call. To identify the business policy to delete, the seller passes in the
										Element:b
											profileId
											value. To delete multiple business policies, you use the
										Element:b
											removeSellerProfiles
											call. To identify the business policies to delete, the seller passes in multiple
										Element:b
											profileIds
											values.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:b
											Note:
											A business policy that is associated to one or more active listings cannot be deleted. Instead, these listings have to be reassigned to other active business policies first using a
										Element:b
											ReviseItem
											call or the Business Policies Management UI. Similarly, the default business policy for a policy type (return, payment, shipping) cannot be deleted.

											Consolidating Similar Shipping Policies
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Shipping business policies that have identical shipping services (with the exception of shipping costs) and identical settings (such as domestic and international shipping types, handling times, ship-to locations, rate tables, etc.) can be consolidated using the
										Element:strong
											consolidateShippingProfiles
											call. When shipping business policies are consolidated, the shipping business policy that is used/referenced by the seller most frequently is kept, and the others are removed from the seller's account. Active or scheduled listings inherit the shipping business policy (and all its values/settings) that is kept after the consolidation, but the shipping costs that were specified for each shipping service in the newly deleted shipping policies are kept on the respective listings.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:b
											consolidateShippingProfiles
											call runs asynchronously. The status of a shipping policy consolidation job can be retrieved by using the
										Element:strong
											getConsolidationJobStatus
											call.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:b
											Note:
											As a seller continues to create numerouse listings, there's a good chance that permutations in shipping settings will continue to accumulate. Due to this reason, it is recommended that client applications are set up to execute regular
										Element:strong
											consolidateShippingProfiles
											calls.

											Overriding Shipping Costs at the Listing Level
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:p
											The shipping costs for all domestic and international shipping services, that are defined in the
										Element:strong
											domesticShippingPolicyInfoService
											and
										Element:strong
											intlShippingPolicyInfoService
											containers of the shipping policy, can be overridden by supplying a
										Element:strong
											ShippingServiceCostOverrideList.ShippingServiceCostOverride
											container for each domestic and international shipping service defined through the shipping policy.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Shipping costs include the shipping cost to ship one item (
										Element:strong
											ShippingServiceCost
											in Trading API), the shipping cost to ship each additional identical item for a multi-quantity listing (
										Element:strong
											ShippingServiceAdditionalCost
											in Trading API), and a shipping surcharge if one is applicable for the shipping service (
										Element:strong
											ShippingSurcharge
											in Trading API).
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											For all domestic shipping services defined in the shipping business policy, the
										Element:strong
											ShippingServiceType
											field in the
										Element:strong
											ShippingServiceCostOverrideList.ShippingServiceCostOverride
											container should be set to 'Domestic', and for all international shipping services defined in the shipping business policy, the
										Element:strong
											ShippingServiceType
											field should be set to 'International'. For both domestic and international shipping services, the
										Element:strong
											ShippingServicePriority
											value in the
										Element:strong
											ShippingServiceCostOverrideList.ShippingServiceCostOverride
											container should match the
										Element:strong
											sortOrderId
											value for the matching shipping service in the shipping business policy.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:b
											Note:
											Once a shipping cost value is overridden on an active listing, it remains overridden, even if its respective value is changed in the shipping business policy that is associated to that listing.
