										Element:p
											You can filter the list of returned People using the
										Element:code
											filters
											parameter, giving you the ability to fine-tune your query based on the rich tracking information stored in GoSquared.
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Results can be filtered on
										Element:code
											events
											(see
										Element:a
											Event Types
											) or
										Element:code
											properties
											(see
										Element:a
											Property Types

											The
										Element:code
											filters
											is somewhat complex so we advise that you
										Element:a
											look at an existing Smart Group
											to begin with to see how your pre-existing Smart Groups filter results. Using the Query Builder on the right you can graphically build up a
										Element:code
											filters
											object using any combination of filters. You can then see the
										Element:code
											Example Request
											below with the generated json query.
