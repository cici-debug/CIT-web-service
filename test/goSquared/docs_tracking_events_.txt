					Event tracking with GoSquared
			Node:

				Element:p
					Events are a versatile way of tracking
				Element:em
					anything
					that is happening on your site or app. They are very simple, consisting of a name, and optionally a payload of data to store along with the event.
				Element:strong
					Event payloads are not currently searchable
					, but they can be viewed on a per profile basis in GoSquared People.
			Node:

				Element:p
					Take some time to think about the name you give to your events. You can name them anything you like, but it's best to use a clear, concise name.
