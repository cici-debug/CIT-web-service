								Properties are an excellent way of getting to know your users. They contain user information and state.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								All properties can be used to search, filter and sort your users in
							Element:a
								GoSquared People
								. The more you track, the better you can understand your users.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								GoSquared defines a list of common properties that are useful to track. Some of these special properties are used by GoSquared to provide powerful functionality. For example, email is used to look up additional information about an individual from publicly available sources.

								Custom properties
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Besides special properties, you can track any property of any data type and GoSquared will make that data searchable, sortable and filterable. Place your custom properties under the custom property.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								GoSquared People needs to know about what kind of data each custom property contains – whether the property is text, a number, or a date etc. Therefore, when you track a custom property, it is automatically assigned a “type” based on the value you send. GoSquared People can then make sure the data is searched, sorted and filtered in the correct way for that data. Possible types are
							Element:code
								Text
								,
							Element:code
								Number
								,
							Element:code
								Date
								,
							Element:code
								Boolean
								and
							Element:code
								Null
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For example, if you send a
							Element:code
								subscription_created
								property with a value like
							Element:code
								2015-03-03T15:00:00+00:00
								, it will be assigned the
							Element:code
								Date
								type. Alternatively, if you send a
							Element:code
								subscription_value
								property with a value like
							Element:code
								49.99
								, it will be assigned the
							Element:code
								Number
								type. Date detection is fairly lenient, so long as it resembles at least a portion of an ISO 8601 string.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								GoSquared People will always try its best to figure out the most appropriate type for your custom properties. Sometimes it’s not always possible to get it exactly right, such as if you send a numeric Unix timestamp and want it treated as a date. In those cases, you can manually correct the property type in your
							Element:a
								Project Settings
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once a custom property is tracked, it will appear in the custom properties list in the People section of
							Element:a
								Project Settings
								. There, you can manually change the type of the custom property. This might be necessary if you track a custom property with the wrong data, or if you wish to change what the custom property is used for.

								How many different custom properties can I track?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Each GoSquared project can track up to
							Element:strong
								1000 custom properties
								. Above this limit, properties with new names will be ignored in that project.
