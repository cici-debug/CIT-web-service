					Rate Limits
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The rate limit currently stands at
				Element:strong
					750 units per minute
					per user. Each API function has a cost, which is deducted from your rate limit when you call it. Rate limits aren't reset, instead they are replenished continuously - so after 30 seconds, a previously empty rate limit will have 375 units available.

											Spread your requests
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Performing a high number of API calls in a short space of time will quickly use your rate limit. Spreading the requests over a minute or so will allow the rate limit to replenish so you are less likely to get limited.

							Element:ul
							Element:li
								The
							Element:a
								Tracking API
								is not rate limited, instead it's covered by your
							Element:a
								Account Limits
								.
							Element:li
								GoSquared dashboards use the API and therefore use your rate limit, but the cost of each function is divided by 8.
							Element:li
								If you need a higher limit then get in contact through our
							Element:a
								support page
								where we can arrange a custom package.

											HTTP Headers and Response Codes
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											API responses contain
										Element:code
											X-RateLimit
											headers which can be used to monitor and control your usage.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If the cost of the API function is higher than the number of remaining units, the API will respond with a
										Element:code
											HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
											status code and a
										Element:code
											Retry-After
											header informing you how many seconds you must wait before you can retry the request.
