					Combining Functions
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Combing functions is one of the most powerful features of the GoSquared API. For each API, multiple GET requests can be combined into one - minimising network usage and offering far greater flexibility.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					You can even get multiples of the same resource in one request (e.g. Getting
				Element:a
					Time Series
					data for this Friday as well as last Friday)

											Multiple functions
									Node:

										Element:p
											You can retrieve multiple different endpoints at the same time by separating them with a comma. For example, to retrieve both a list of
										Element:a
											currently online browsers
											and a list of
										Element:a
											countries of online visitors

										Element:code
											countries
									Node:

										Element:p
											This will retrieve both timeSeries and concurrents data. In the response (demonstrated on the right).
									Node:

										Element:p
											In addition to this you can specify query parameters for each function by prefixing them with the function name e.g.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:code
											?
										Element:strong
										Element:code
											browsers:
										Element:code
											limit=2
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Combining functions is currently only possible directly via the HTTP API.
