											Custom properties
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Besides special properties, you can track any property of any data type and GoSquared will make that data searchable, sortable and filterable. Place your custom properties under the
										Element:code
											custom
											property.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:a
											GoSquared People
											needs to know about what kind of data each custom property contains – whether the property is text, a number, or a date etc. Therefore, when you track a custom property, it is automatically assigned a “type” based on the value you send.
										Element:a
											GoSquared People
											can then make sure the data is searched, sorted and filtered in the correct way for that data. Possible types are Text, Number, Date, Boolean and Null.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											For example, if you send a subscription_created property with a value like
										Element:code
											2015-03-03T15:00:00+00:00
											, it will be assigned the date type. Alternatively, if you send a subscription_value property with a value like 49.99, it will be assigned the number type. Date detection is fairly lenient, so long as it resembles at least a portion of an ISO 8601 string.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:a
											GoSquared People
											will always try its best to figure out the most appropriate type for your custom properties. Sometimes it’s not always possible to get it exactly right, such as if you send a numeric Unix timestamp and want it treated as a date. In those cases, you can manually correct the property type in the People section of
										Element:a
											Site Settings
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Once a custom property is tracked, it will appear in the custom properties list in the
										Element:a
											GoSquared People
											section of
										Element:a
											Site Settings
											. There, you can manually change the type of the custom property. This might be necessary if you track a custom property with the wrong data, or if you wish to change what the custom property is used for.
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:p
											If you know the ID of the visitor, it is safer to use the
										Element:a
											Identify
											function as it will ensure that the ID is properly set.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You can set properties on unidentified visitors and they'll be merged into the identified profile as soon as they become identified.
