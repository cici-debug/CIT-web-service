								My tracking code doesn't seem to be working
						Node:

							Element:p
								Please double check that the tracking code is installed just before the

								If you're trying to track a site on the
							Element:code
								file://
								protocol (local files) or on
							Element:code
								localhost
								, the tracker will not track visitors by default. This is to prevent local development from skewing reported traffic levels, but if you'd like it enabled, just add
							Element:code
								_gs('set', 'trackLocal', true);
								after the tracking code.

								Performance is extremely important to us and we pride ourselves on having one of the most lightweight tracking scripts in the business. The tracking code will always load asynchronously ensuring that it will never block anything from loading on your site. This makes us extremely confident when saying that GoSquared will have zero to negligible impact on your site's performance.

								Can I track subdomains with GoSquared?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								We recommend using multiple tracking codes for subdomain tracking. Essentially, track each subdomain as a separate GoSquared project, this will create a unique tracking code for each subdomain. Then create one extra project and put its tracking code across all your subdomains to create a total global traffic dashboard. Read the
							Element:a
								full subdomain guide
								for advice on tracking People profiles and Live Chat history across subdomains.
