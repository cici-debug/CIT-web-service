								Transactions are a special type of event, used to track when a user has purchased something from you. The data is reported in
							Element:a
								Ecommerce Analytics
								and
							Element:a
								GoSquared People
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Transactions can be tracked either in the browser using the JavaScript Tracker when a user completes a purchase, or on the backend when your application processes the transaction.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If a transaction ID is specified, it will be checked for uniqueness to prevent duplicate transactions from being tracked.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								By default, GoSquared calculates the total revenue and quantity amount from the items in the transaction. You may want to override this in some cases, such as when a discount was applied. This is possible by specifying revenue and quantity totals in the transaction options.
