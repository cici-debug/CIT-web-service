								API Key Scopes
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you create an API Key for your account, you can choose to grant it a set of
							Element:em
								scopes
								which indicate what permissions are associated with that API Key. Scopes restrict access for a particular API Key to specific sections of the API, and prevent applications from accessing, tracking or modifying data when they shouldn't.

								Your API Key must be included with all requests and in most cases the site_token as well.
