								To create/update profiles in GoSquared People and track individual users, you will need to call the identify method and provide a
							Element:code
								person_id
								. The
							Element:code
								person_id
								can be a unique ID or the person's email address. You can also track additional information as properties.

											Track via email address
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To use an email address as the person_id you must use the prefix
										Element:code
											email:
											like this:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:code
											person_id: "email:user@example.com"
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This will also automatically fill in the email property with the address provided.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											Note
											: Tracking users by their ID and email separately will create two different profiles. GoSquared will merge these two profiles together when you next identify a user with both ID and email in the properties of the same identify call.
									Node:

										Element:p
											Identify is very similar to
										Element:a
											properties
											, but it requires there to be an identifying property (id or email).

								How many different custom properties can I track?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Take some time to think about the name you give to your properties. You can name them anything you like, but it's best to use a clear, concise name.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Each GoSquared project can track up to
							Element:strong
								1000 custom properties
								. Above this limit, properties with new names will be ignored in that project.
