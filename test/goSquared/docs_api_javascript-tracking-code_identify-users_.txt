					Identify Users
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Calling the identify function creates or updates a profile in
				Element:a
					GoSquared People
					. You can pass back as many different properties about that user as you like. A cookie is also set that tracks the user's pageviews/events against their People profile.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					GoSquared defines a list of common properties that are useful to track, shown in the table below.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					An
				Element:code
					id
					or
				Element:code
					email
					address is needed to identify somebody. You can set both, but only one is required.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
				Element:strong
					Note
					: Tracking users by their
				Element:code
					id
					and
				Element:code
					email
					separately will create two different profiles. GoSquared will merge these two profiles together when you next identify a user with both
				Element:code
					id
					and
				Element:code
					email
					in the properties of the same identify call.
