								API Key Scopes
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you create an API Key for your account, you can choose to grant it a set of
							Element:em
								scopes
								which indicate what permissions are associated with that API Key. Scopes restrict access for a particular API Key to specific sections of the API, and prevent applications from accessing, tracking or modifying data when they shouldn't.
