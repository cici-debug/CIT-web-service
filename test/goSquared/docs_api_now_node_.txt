					The Now API provides real-time

					concurrent
					information about your sites and apps, such as the number of concurrent visitors online, the most popular pages right now, the most influential traffic sources, and much more.
			Node:

				Element:p
					For sites with minimal traffic, the Now API will often be less useful as the information is about concurrent activity on your site right now. We recommend the
				Element:a
					Trends API
					for sites that average less than 10 concurrent visitors online.

								Combining Functions
								for information on how to achieve this.
