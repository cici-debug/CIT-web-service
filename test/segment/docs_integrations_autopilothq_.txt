					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					AutopilotHQ
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to AutopilotHQ in the format they understand.

					The Segment AutopilotHQ integration is 100% handled through Segment, meaning you don’t need to load Autopilothq on your site.
