								Getting Started
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you toggle on Sendinblue in Segment, the following happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Sendinblue will record all of your identify events sent via the .identify() method. You can then use that data to create custom scenarios in the Sendinblue Marketing Automation interface.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Since Sendinblue only records custom user data, no users will appear in sendinblue until you identify a user for the first time.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Note
								: Sendinblue will record only the Segment identify call type to identify the users in Sendinblue. Sendinblue is working on the other call types and will update them on the Segment when available.

								Identify
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you call
							Element:a
								Identify
								on Analytics.js, we first call Sendinblue‚Äô
							Element:a
								identify
								method. Please note you need to send the email address of the user to let Sendinblue identify the user. It will help us track your customers and users, as well as track their actions.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Here‚Äôs an example identify call that you can send:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								analytics.identify('<%= current_user.id %>', { email: '<%= current_user.email %>', name: '<%= current_user.name %>', mobile: '<%= current_user.mobile %>', location: '<%= current_user.location %>', plan: '<%= current_user.plan %>', country: '<%= current_user.country %>' });
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Here‚Äôs how we create the Sendinblue Identify object:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:p
								The id parameter (the first argument) will not be set to any sendinblue parameter, but it is mandatory for the segment Identify call.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								The email from the traits parameter (the second argument) will set to the unique and mandatory parameter with which you define your customer in Sendinblue.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								The other traits parameter (the second argument) will be set to user_data as a JSON object (second parameter in Sendinblue‚Äôs identify call). You can pass any number of user properties in this object. Keep in mind that those user properties will populate your database on the Marketing Automation platform to create rich scenarios.
