					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Facebook App Events
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Facebook App Events in the format they understand.

								Segment SDK Integration
						Node:

							Element:p
								Simply integrate one of Segment’s latest mobile SDKs into your app and we can send all of the data to facebook via our servers so you don’t need to add another SDK to your app. This is the recommended method for sending your app event data to facebook and it doesn’t require adding any additional SDKs.
						Node:

								Once you turn on the Facebook App Events integration in your app’s Segment project, we’ll start sending

								If you send a

								event that doesn’t match one of the above events, we’ll send it along to Facebook with the name you provide Segment. Facebook App Events doesn’t like events with periods in the name so if you send us an event with periods in the name, we’ll convert all periods to underscores. So if your event is
							Element:code
								friend.added
								, we’ll send that to facebook as
							Element:code
								friend_added
								. We also trunacte events that are longer than 40 characters long due to Facebook’s API constraints.
						Node:

								explicitly, we send
							Element:code
								USD
								. We’ll also truncate the event name to 40 characters to conform to Facebook’s identifer requirements.
