					SQL integrations are for Business level customers that have raw access to their data. We host a SQL database on Amazon Redshift, and your application connects to that endpoint to run queries, provide visualization, reporting etc. Customer data is stored given a standard
				Element:a
					schema
					, which is based on the
				Element:a
					Segment Spec
					. Customers can also add custom tables to their SQL instance. This is the best integration method for business intelligence tools.

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Complete the
							Element:a
								integration survey
								to help us understand what your business does, how to present it to customers, and evaluate whether your application would be a good fit for the Segment ecosystem.

								2. Add a connection option for Segment SQL.
						Node:

							Element:p
								To integrate, you have to build a Segment SQL connector. A Segment SQL connector is a connection to an Amazon Redshift database where certain parameters are fixed.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The only credentials that change for each customer are:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:code
								Organization Slug
								the sub-sub-domain on the host, for example
							Element:em
								partners
								.sql.segment.com
							Element:li
							Element:code
								Username
							Element:li
							Element:code
								Password
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you build your Segment SQL Connector you should only collect those three fields from the user.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The connection credentials will look like:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								Host: <organization-slug>.sql.segment.com Port: 5439 User: <username> Password: <password> Database: events
						Node:
						(type) c

								For example JackDB has created a Segment SQL connector in their interface which takes settings from the JackDB integration in the Segment control panel

						Node:

								To verify that your integration connects properly to Segment, shoot us an email at friends@segment.com and we’ll send you the credentials to connect to a demo dataset.

								3. Submit your Application for Review!
						Node:

								Once you’ve verified that you can connect to Segment SQL, complete the
							Element:a
								SQL Integration application
								!
						Node:

								Due to the high volume of requests, it may take up to a week for Segment to review your application. At the end of the application, there is an option to get a link to edit your response to the form or send a copy.
