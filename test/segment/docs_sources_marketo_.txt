					Take your company’s analysis to the next level by having SQL access to all your Marketo data alongside your customer event data in Redshift and Postgres.

					With your Marketo data in your warehouse, you’ll be able to analyze your lists, leads, campaigns, landing pages, emails, segmentations, segments and (coming soon) opportunities in SQL. Even cooler, you’ll be able to join your Marketo data with the Segment event data you’re already sending to your warehouse, so you can now do things like combining your campaign and product usage data and analyzing your leads alongside website activity.
