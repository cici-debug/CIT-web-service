								Getting Started
						Node:

							Element:p
								When you toggle on Keen IO in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading keen.js onto your page. This means you should remove Keen IO‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Since Keen IO only records custom events and custom user data, no events or users will appear in Keen IO until you start using the API outlined below.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2

								Keen IO is supported on the client side and server side.

											When you call

								We offer an optional

								Cloud-based
								Connection Mode for

								Web
								data with Keen IO. As a reminder, this removes the Keen IO javascript library from your site, improving performance. However, there are a few disparities between the Cloud-based and Device-based connection modes to keep in mind brefore enabling it in the Segment app. When you enable the
							Element:strong
								Cloud-based
								integration mode, here‚Äôs what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The latest version is compatible with the prior, but is required for Cloud-based Connection Mode Support. For data
							Element:em
								recording
								use cases, we recommend using the
							Element:em
								cloud-based
								connection mode with Keen, as our server-side integration offers robust mapping and parity with all of their data enrichment add ons. Note that if you opt out of a device-based connection with Keen, you cannot use their client side library for charting or querying. User data is augmented to the payload in a different manner via our cloud-based integration versus our device-based one, so we recommend writing to a new, dedicated stream if you elect to use the cloud-based connection mode.
