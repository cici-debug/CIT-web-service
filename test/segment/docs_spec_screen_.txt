					The
				Element:code
					screen
					call lets you record whenever a user sees a screen, the mobile equivalent of
				Element:code
					page
					, in your mobile app, along with any properties about the screen. Calling
				Element:code
					page
					or
				Element:a
					in one of our
				Element:code
					screen
				Element:a
					sources
					is one of the first steps to getting started with Segment.

					Here’s the payload of a typical
				Element:code
					screen
					call, with most
				Element:a
					common fields
					removed:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					{ "type": "screen", "name": "Photo Feed", "properties": { "Feed Type": "private" } }
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					And here’s the corresponding Objective-C event that would generate the above payload:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] screen:@"Home" properties:@{ @"Feed Type": @"private" }];
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Beyond the common fields, the
				Element:code
					screen
					call takes the following fields:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:table
				Element:tr
					_
				Element:th
				Element:strong
					Field
				Element:th
				Element:strong
					Type

					Description
				Element:tr
				Element:td
				Element:code

				Element:em
					optional
				Element:td

				Element:td
					Name of the screen

								The Anonymous ID can be any pseudo-unique identifier, for cases where you don’t know who the user is, but you still want to tie them to an event. Check out the

								Note: In our browser and mobile libraries a User ID is automatically added
