								Getting Started
						Node:

							Element:p
								When you toggle on SnapEngage in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading SnapEngage‚Äôs javascript onto your page. This means you should remove SnapEngage‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								SnapEngage‚Äôs chat box will appear on your page and you can start chatting with visitors.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								SnapEngage is only supported on the client-side.

								Record Live Chat Events
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								With this integration, you can automatically record
							Element:code
								track
								events for live chat conversations. If you select this option, we‚Äôll collect the following events:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Live Chat Conversation Started
							Element:li
								Live Chat Conversation Ended
							Element:li
								Live Chat Message Sent
							Element:li
								Live Chat Message Received
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								These events will then flow out to your other tools, so you can do things like analyze if users who chat spend more money over time.
						Node:
						(type) c

								To learn more about the live chat events you can capture with this integration, head on over to our
