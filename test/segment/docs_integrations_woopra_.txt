					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					Woopra
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Woopra in the format they understand.

								When you toggle on Woopra in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Woopra‚Äôs javascript onto your page. This means you should remove Woopra‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Woopra will start automatically collecting data on your site.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2

								Woopra is supported on client-side and server-side.

						Node:

								When you call

							Element:code
								referrer
								,
							Element:code
								path
								, and etc. If you pass a
							Element:code
								name
								in your
							Element:code
								.page()
								call, we will send that as
							Element:code
								title
								to Woopra.
						Node:

											Tying server side events to client side sessions
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you want your server side events to be seen as part of the same ‚Äúsource‚Äù or session as your client side events, all you have to do is pass us the
										Element:code
											wooTracker
											value inside your cookie. Luckily, you can easily retrieve this value by:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											analytics.ready(function(){ var woopraCookie = window.woopra.cookie; // pass this value to your server });
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Now from the server side, you can attach it to the
										Element:code
											integrations.Woopra.cookie
											property:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											(Ruby example)
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											Analytics.track( user_id: '019mr8mf4r', event: 'Purchased Item', properties: { revenue: 39.95, shipping: '2-day' }, integrations: { Woopra: { cookie: <wooTracker value> } })
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This should let Woopra know that this server side event is part of the same session as the client.
										Element:em
											Important
											: Make sure
										Element:code
											Woopra
											is capitalized!

											Split user profiles
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you are seeing split user profiles, the most likely culprit is that you are calling
										Element:code
											.identify()
											only on the backend using one of our server side libraries but
										Element:strong
											NOT
											on the client side with
										Element:code
											analytics.js
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Calling
										Element:code
											.identify()
											in the browser will effectively map the
										Element:code
											userId
											you passed in with the
										Element:code
											wooTracker
											cookie value. So in the event that you call
										Element:code
											.identify()
											on the server side first, you
										Element:strong
											MUST
											call
										Element:code
											.identify()
											on the client side as well to tie the
										Element:code
											wooTracker
											cookie to that
										Element:code
											userId
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Doing so will ensure that duplicate profiles are not created.
