								The first thing you‚Äôll want to do is to identify your users so Nudgespot knows who they are. You‚Äôll use the

								method to accomplish this - identify takes the unique user Id of a user, first name, and any other traits you know about them.

											If you already have an app deployed with the Segment source, and you just turned on Nudgespot, it will take up to an hour for all your mobile users to refresh their Segment settings cache, and learn about the new service that you want to send to. After the settings cache refreshes, our source will automatically start sending data to Nudgespot.
