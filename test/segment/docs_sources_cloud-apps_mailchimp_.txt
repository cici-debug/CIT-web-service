					Please Note:
					The Mailchimp Source is still in alpha. Data may sometimes be inaccurate, and the service may occasionally be unavailable or buggy. That said, we’re totally committed to fixing things as quickly as we can, and we’re working to improve it quickly. Our hope is that by opening this up to more users, we can more rapidly improve! In return for early access, we ask for your feedback and bug reports. Thanks!

								Getting Started
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
							Element:p
								From your workspace’s
							Element:code
								/sources
								page, click
							Element:code
								add source
								.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Choose Mailchimp.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Give the source a nickname and a schema name. The nickname will be used to designate the source in the Segment interface, and the schema name is the namespace you’ll be querying against in your warehouse. Both can be whatever you like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the source itself, like
							Element:code
								Mailchimp
								for nickname and
							Element:code
								mailchimp
								or
							Element:code
								email
								or
							Element:code
								chimp_prod
								for the schema name.
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Note
								that you can add multiple instances if you have multiple Mailchimp accounts. That’s why we allow you to customize the source’s nickname and schema name!
							Element:p
							Element:img
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Next, provide credentials to an account with API permissions to access your Mailchimp data. It is recommended that you create a brand new api key for the Segment source. MailChimp restricts each api key to a maximum of 10 concurrent requests, so creating a dedicated one for Segment will ensure maximum throughput. You can find your API key in
							Element:strong
								Account > Extras > API Keys
								. You can read more about API keys on
							Element:a
								MailChimp’s docs

											Sync
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Mailchimp has a sync component, which means we’ll make requests to their API on your behalf on a 3 hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, we’ll grab all the Mailchimp objects (and their corresponding properties) according to the Collections table below. The objects will be written into a separate schema, corresponding to the source instance’s schema name you designated upon creation. For example, if you went with
										Element:code
											mailchimp
											, the
										Element:code
											lists
											collection will be accessible at
										Element:code
											mailchimp.lists
											in SQL.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Our sync component uses an upsert API, so the data in your warehouse loaded via sync will reflect the latest state of the corresponding resource in Mailchimp. For example, if
										Element:code
											status
											goes from
										Element:code
											subscribed
											to
										Element:code
											unsubscribed
											between syncs, on its next sync that tickets status will be
										Element:code
											unsubscribed
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source runs pull your data into the Segment Hub, and warehouse runs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources will sync with Segment every 3 hours. Depending on your Warehouses plan, we will push the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.

											At the moment, we don’t support filtering which objects or properties get synced. If you’re interested in this feature, please let us know!
