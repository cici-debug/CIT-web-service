					Adjust Integration
			Node:

				Element:p
					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Adjust
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Adjust in the format they understand.

								Getting Started
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you toggle on
							Element:strong
								Adjust for a mobile app
								in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:p
								You will need to include Adjust’s library by adding these lines to your dependency config:
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								+ For iOS: `pod "Segment-Adjust"` + For Android:`compile 'com.segment.analytics.android.integrations:adjust:+'`
							Element:li
							Element:p
								After you build and release to the app store, we’ll automatically start translating and sending your data to Adjust.

								Track
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you call
							Element:code
								track
								we’ll automatically translate that (via the event-name-to-custom-Adjust-event-token mapping in your integrations sheet) and send the event to Adjust. If you don’t provide a mapping, Adjust cannot accept the event. We include all the event
							Element:code
								properties
								as callback parameters on the Adjust event, and automatically translate
							Element:code
								revenue
								and
							Element:code
								currency
								to the appropriate Adjust event properties based on our
							Element:a
								spec’d properties
								. Finally, we’ll automatically use Adjust’s
							Element:code
								transactionId
								-based deduplication when you send an an
							Element:code
								orderId
								(see the
							Element:a
								ecommerce spec
								).

											Enter your event on the left, and the Adjust custom event token to map into on the right. Adjust allows you to create custom events under
										Element:code
											Settings > Events
											, which have custom tokens. Adjust’s API only accepts those tokens, not arbitrary event names. Any unmapped events will not be sent to Adjust, since they require a mapped token.
