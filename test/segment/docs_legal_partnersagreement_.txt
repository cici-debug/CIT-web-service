								Segment.io, Inc. (“Segment”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) maintains a platform that enables our customers (“Customers”) to collect and store information about their websites, applications and services, as well as tools and services running on those websites, applications and services, and to share that data with third party service providers, such as analytics service providers (our platform is referred to in this Agreement as “our Service” or the “Segment Service”). The Segment Service further allows Customers to collect, store and share data from and between their various third party service providers.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This is a legal agreement (the “Agreement”) between you (“Partner,” “you” or “your’) and Segment stating the terms that govern the integration of your application or service (“your Service” or the “Partner Service”) with the Segment Service and your subsequent interchange of data with the Segment Service. Please read this Agreement carefully before pressing the “I accept” button or using the Segment Service or Materials (defined below).
							Element:strong
								By pressing “I accept,” or using the Segment Service or Materials, you are agreeing to be bound by this Agreement.

						Node:

							Element:p
								If you enter into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other entity, then (i) “you” includes you and that entity, and (ii) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf.
						Node:

							Element:p
								This Agreement will enable you to integrate your Service with the Segment Service to allow Customers to send and/or receive data (“Customer Data”) between your Service and ours at their direction. This Agreement includes a number of marketing, technical and legal rules and restrictions that we require you to agree with and implement in order to access or use our application programming interface(s) (“API(s)” or the “Segment API(s)”). The Segment API’s, together with any sample code, software, testing tools, documentation, and other materials made available by Segment to you are referred to collectively as the “Segment Materials.” This Agreement defines how you can use the Segment Materials to develop an integration for Customers between your Service and the Segment Service (the “Integration”).
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								This Agreement helps us to maintain and improve the Segment Service as well as the overall Customer experience and our ecosystem. For ease of use, we have broken the Agreement up into a number of modules including the “Developer Documentation” that specifies how to build your Integration and work with the Segment Service, and “Co-Marketing Guidelines” that describe how we cooperate in marketing.
						Node:

								Your Integration and Service are your responsibility! You must thoroughly test your Integration (including any changes or new functionality) prior to implementing it in a production environment or submitting it to Segment for review. We have the right to review and test your Integration at any time. You must reasonably cooperate with any such testing (including providing Segment with a test account, documentation and sample data). In addition, we may require you to implement a beta version of your Integration with a few select Customers. However, Segment has no obligation to test any integration, and, while we may provide test tools, review results and even conduct our own testing, our tests are not a certification or guarantee of your functionality. By investigating, reviewing or approving any Integration or Partner Service, Segment is not making any representation or warranty regarding your Integration or Service, or its compliance with this Agreement, and you are still fully responsible for full and complete compliance with this Agreement. You hereby permit Segment to use your Service and Integration (and any related materials, information or documentation that you provide) as required to test, evaluate and monitor your Service and Integration in connection with this Agreement, and to deliver the Segment Service via your Integration, as set forth in this Agreement.
