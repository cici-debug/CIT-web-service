					The
				Element:code
					page
					call lets you record whenever a user sees a page of your website, along with any optional properties about the page. Calling
				Element:code
					page
					or
				Element:a
					in one of our
				Element:code
					screen
				Element:a
					sources
					is one of the first steps to getting started with Segment.

				Element:p
				Element:strong
					Note:
				Element:strong
					In
					just after
				Element:code
					analytics.js
					a
				Element:code
					page
					call is included in the snippet by default
				Element:code
					analytics.load
					. We do that because you
				Element:strong
					must
					call this method at least once per page load. However, you can choose to add an optional
				Element:code
					name
					or
				Element:code
					properties
					to the default call, or call it multiple times if you have a single-page application.

					Here’s the payload of a typical
				Element:code
					page
					call with most
				Element:a
					common fields
					removed:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					{ "type": "page", "name": "Home", "properties": { "title": "Welcome | Initech", "url": "http://www.initech.com" } }
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					And here’s the corresponding Javascript event that would generate the above payload. If you’re using Segment’s Javascript library, the page name and URL are automatically gathered and passed as properties into the event payload:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					analytics.page("Home");
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Beyond the common fields, the
				Element:code
					page
					call takes the following fields:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:table
				Element:tr
				Element:th
				Element:strong
					Field
				Element:th
				Element:strong
					Type
				Element:th
				Element:strong
					Description
				Element:tr
				Element:td
				Element:code
					name
				Element:em
					optional
				Element:td
					String
				Element:td
					Name of the page
				Element:p
					For example, most sites have a “Signup” page that can be useful to tag, so you can see users as they move through your funnel.
				Element:tr
				Element:td
				Element:code
					properties
				Element:em
					optional
				Element:td
					Object
				Element:td
					Free-form dictionary of properties of the page, like
				Element:code
					url
					and
				Element:code
					referrer
				Element:p
					See the
				Element:a

								We’ve reserved some properties that have semantic meanings, and we handle them in special ways. For example, we always expect

								to be the URL path of a page, and

								referrer
								to be the URL of the previous page.
						Node:
