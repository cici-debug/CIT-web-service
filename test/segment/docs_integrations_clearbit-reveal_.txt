								To set up the integration, you must enter the secret key, not the public key Clearbit provides. To verify that the integration has been set up correctly, check the Debugger section of your Segment Source. Assuming everything has been set up correctly, you should start seeing Clearbit data populate in the
							Element:code
								page
								events ‚Äì click on the specific event you‚Äôre interested in to see Clearbit traits. These traits will now be available to other Segment integrations in your account. Notice that all Clearbit traits are prefixed with clearbit_ to ensure they don‚Äôt conflict with existing traits.
