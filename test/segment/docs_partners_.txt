								Segment allows our mutual customers to collect customer data from many different sources, and leverage that same data in a broad ecosystem of tools spanning analytics, advertising, marketing automation, CRM, BI and more.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The first step is collecting data. Our customers can send data from the client (browser/mobile) and from the server. We support over a dozen languages and platforms. Here is the latest list of all of our
							Element:a
								sources
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This data is sent according to the
							Element:a
								spec
								that we have defined in our API. Our API is focused entirely on customer data:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Who is this?
							Element:code
								.identify(userId, traits)
							Element:li
								What are they doing?
							Element:code
								.track(userId, event, properties)
							Element:li
								Where are they doing it?
							Element:code
								.page(userId, pageName, properties)
							Element:li
								What group are they part of?
							Element:code
								.group(userId, groupId, groupTraits)
						Node:
						(type) c

								If your service runs on this kind of data, you can integrate with Segment.

								Customers can also use Segment Warehouses to send their raw event data and data from cloud sources like Salesforce, Zendesk, and Stripe to a Redshift or Postgres data warehouse. If you offer a data warehouse solution or tool that connects to one, you can apply as a Warehouse Partner.

								How does a customer enable an integration?
						Node:

								Segment’s core feature is our integrations control panel:

							Element:p
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Customers enter the integration settings that are necessary for sending data to your service. Then they press “enable”, and we’ll start sending their data to you within a minute or two.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For Warehouse partners, customers will need to enter their credentials in our Warehouse setup flow. For any analytics partner that connects to Segment Warehouses, customers will need to follow your usual onboarding flow to enable your tool.

								What kinds of integrations can I build?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								There are three different ways to integrate with Segment: Direct, Packaged, and Warehouse.

											Direct
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The recommended, easiest way to get integrated with Segment is to build a Direct integration. With this integration, Segment will forward all of the incoming data for our mutual customers to your service’s HTTP endpoint in realtime.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											A Direct integration gives you complete control over how you want to store, transform and process the data. It means that our customers can immediately start sending you data from any one of our
										Element:a
											sources
											—from the browser, from their mobile apps, or from their servers—with no added work. Segment Business plan customers can also replay histroic data, which means you can demonstrate the value of your tool rapidly.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This type of integration works well for analytics tools, email marketing tools, attribution tools, CRMs, raw data tools, helpdesks, customer success tools, etc.

											Packaged
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This is the appropriate integration method if your application relies on third party cookies (Advertising pixels), needs to modify the UI (e.g. A/B testing, Push Notification, In-App Messaging and LiveChat), or needs to collect ambient data in the client (Heatmapping, Error & Performance Monitoring tools).
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											On mobile, this is the integration method if you need to embed your SDK with the Segment SDK.
									Node:

											At the moment, Segment is only onboarding packaged partners for our mobile platform via iOS and Android Integrations. Browser based packaged integrations, i.e. an integration that is embedded in the browser, are up next! If your tool falls in that category, fill out the
										Element:a
											partner application
											and we will let you know when we are ready to support you! We’re hard at work investing in the infrastructure to make adding these types of tools seamless.

										Element:h3
											Warehouse
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This is the appropriate integration method for new database connections for Segment Warehouses or business intelligence tools that read from a SQL database, like Tableau or Chartio. Customers can use these tools to analyze their raw event data and data from cloud app sources like Salesforce or Zendesk.

											Once you are accepted onto the platform and build your integration, Segment will make your integration live once you have ten customers testing the integration. From there, we’ll monitor your growth and provide guidance around maintaining and improving integration quality. If there is a mutual customer who is doing something exciting with your integration, let us know! You can check out our
										Element:a
											co-marketing page
											for more information.

								I need immediate access to a Segment customer’s data stream.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Often companies get referred to Segment by current Segment user’s who are trying to avoid integrating an additional third party service. If you need immediate access to a mutual customer or prospect’s Segment data stream you can ask them to send you their data stream via the
							Element:a
								Segment Webhook integration
								. This integration will make HTTP(s) POST requests with JSON objects that represent their user behavioral data stream as implemented in with the Segment API on their website, mobile app or server. Please note, the structure of the Webhook data stream is different from the Direct Partner integration data stream but is very similar.
