				Element:ul

					Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Ramen’s JavaScript library onto your page. This means you should remove Ramen’s snippet from your page if you already have it there. ​
				Element:li
					As of March 2016, Ramen supports asking questions of anonymous website visitors in addition to logged-in users. Calling
				Element:a
					,
				Element:code
					page
				Element:a
					, and
				Element:code
					track
				Element:a
					will work without calling
				Element:code
					group
				Element:a
					. However, when you call
				Element:code
					identify
				Element:a
					you
				Element:code
					identify
				Element:em
					must
					pass in an
				Element:code
					id
					or else the Ramen integration will ignore the call. ​

								​ When you call

						Node:

							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:code
								id
								becomes the

							Element:li
							Element:code

								becomes the

								of the user in Ramen.
							Element:li
							Element:code

								name
								of the user in Ramen.
							Element:li
							Element:code
								created_at

								Date
								or seconds since the epoch.
							Element:li
								If
							Element:code
								company
								is an
							Element:code
								Object
								with an
							Element:code

								attribute, we’ll treat that information as if it was passed to
							Element:a
								and create a company in Ramen.
							Element:code

							Element:li
								Attributes with names ending in

								Note:
								Ramen will ignore any calls to

							Element:h2
								Group
								​ Segment supports Ramen Companies in Analytics.js through the
							Element:a
								method. Users can be put into multiple groups, which will associate them to multiple companies in Ramen. ​ Here is a full example, which we will annotate below: ​
							Element:code
								group
							Element:pre
								​ Here is a list of the attributes we process: ​
							Element:code
								analytics.group('314159', { name: 'Ryan Angilly', url: 'https://charturl.com', created_at: 1234567890, is_awesome: true, plan: 'Startup', mrr: 149.99 });

							Element:code

								company_created_at
								timestamp for the company in Ramen. It can be passed in as a

								Other attributes can be passed in as well, and will parsed according to the same rules as denoted in the
							Element:a
								section. ​ ​
							Element:code
								identify
							Element:h2
								Page
								​ When you call
							Element:a
								on Analytics.js, it registers a new pageview in Ramen and checks to see if any questions should be asked. ​ Ramen does not support passing in any attributes to
							Element:code
								page
							Element:code
								page
								. You can call
							Element:code
								page({ title: "Our page" })
								but the attributes (ie.
							Element:code

								in this example) will be ignored. ​ ​
							Element:h2
								Track
								​ When you call
							Element:a
								on Analytics.js, it registers a new event in Ramen and checks to see if any questions should be asked. ​ Ramen does not support passing in any attributes to
							Element:code
								track
							Element:code
								track
								beyond the event name. You can call
							Element:code
								track('Subscribed', { plan: "Startup" })
								but the attributes (ie.

									Node:

											​ If you want to enable Ramen
										Element:a
											secure mode
											for analytics.js, you can pass in the
										Element:code
											timestamp
											and
										Element:code
											auth_hash
											variables by rendering it in your server-side templates. ​ The
										Element:code
											timestamp
											should be a Unix timestamp (epoch seconds). The
										Element:code
											auth_hash
											is a SHA256 has of several attributes. The hash is not based on the email, it is based on: ​
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											user.email - If you do not store emails for your customers, use an empty string
										Element:li
											user.id
										Element:li
											user.name - If you do not have a name for your customers, use their email address or an empty string
										Element:li
											timestamp
										Element:li
											Ramen API Secret ​ Here’s an example of a Ruby web server rendering an identify call with secure mode: ​
										Element:pre
											​
										Element:code
											analytics.identify('<%= current_user.id %>', { email : '<%= current_user.email %>', createdAt : <%= current_user.created_at.to_i %> }, { integrations: { Ramen : { timestamp: <%= @ts ||= Time.now.to_i %>, auth_hash : '<%= (Digest::SHA256.new << "#{current_user.email}:#{current_user.id}:#{current_user.name}:#{@ts}:RAMEN_ORGANIZATION_SECRET_KEY").to_s %>' } } });
										Element:code
											RAMEN_ORGANIZATION_SECRET_KEY
											is found in Ramen’s RamenJS documentation. ​ ​

											An invalid

										Element:li
											Not including
										Element:code
											timestamp
											and
										Element:code
											auth_hash
											once Secure Mode has been enabled. You can see if Secure Mode is enabled by visiting your RamenJS settings page in Ramen. ​ If the above all look correct, and you are sending
										Element:code
											timestamp
											and
										Element:code
											auth_hash
											, check the following: ​
										Element:li
										Element:code
											timestamp
											is being dynamically generated (ie. it is not accidentally hard-coded).
										Element:li
										Element:code
											auth_hash
											is being calculated correctly ​ If you are still having trouble, you can email
