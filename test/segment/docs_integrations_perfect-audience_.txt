					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					Perfect Audience
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Perfect Audience in the format they understand.

								Getting Started
						Node:

							Element:p
								When you toggle on Perfect Audience in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Perfect Audience’s javascript onto your page. This means you should remove Perfect Audience’s snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Perfect Audience will automatically start recording data.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Perfect Audience is only supported on the client-side.

								Page
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You must call page for Perfect Audience to load. We already include a call to
							Element:code
								analytics.page
								in your default Segment snippet, so if you haven’t removed that, Perfect Audience will work the same as if you installed the Perfect Audience snippet directly.

								Track
						Node:

								When you call

								track
								on analytics.js, we call Perfect Audience’s
							Element:code
								track
								with the exact same parameters.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Perfect Audience requires that you define your goals ahead of time in their interface. If that hasn’t happened, then they don’t track the events.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:a
								Here’s their video of how to set that up
								- you’ll need to match event names between Perfect Audience and your Segment track calls.

											Script unverified or undetected by third-party tool
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Many times this is a limitation on the tool’s detection process, where the detector is looking for a specific HTML element on your page. Our client side analytics.js library asynchronously loads the tool’s library or pixel onto the page. As such, the detection fails.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In order to confirm that the tool’s library or pixel is actually loaded onto the page, you can open up the
										Element:a
											javascript console
											and go to the network tab when the page is loading.
