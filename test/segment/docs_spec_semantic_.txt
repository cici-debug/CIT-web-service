					One of the core components of the Segment
				Element:a
					Spec
					is the
				Element:a
					call. It describes any arbitrary event that the user has triggered. For some industry verticals and applications, we’ve standardized event names. For Ecommerce tracking, for example, there are
				Element:code
					track
				Element:strong
					specific event names and properties
					that we recognize semantically. This semantic meaning allows us to specially recognize and transform key events before sending them off to each different tool.
