								Getting Started

							Element:ol
							Element:li
							Element:p
								From your workspace’s
							Element:code
								sources
								page, click
							Element:code
								add source
								.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Choose Stripe.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Give the source a nickname and a schema name. The nickname will be used to designate the source in the Segment interface, and the schema name is the namespace you’ll be querying against in your warehouse. Both can be whatever you like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the source itself, like
							Element:code
								Stripe
								for nickname and
							Element:code
								stripe
								or
							Element:code
								stripe_prod
								for the schema name.
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Note
								that you can add multiple instances if you have multiple Stripe accounts. That’s why we allow you to customize the source’s nickname and schema name!

											Sync
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The Stripe source is built with a sync component, which means we’ll make requests to their API on your behalf on a 3 hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, we’ll grab all the Stripe objects (and their corresponding properties) according to the Collections Table below. The objects will be written into a separate schema, corresponding to the source instance’s schema name you designated upon creation (ie.
										Element:code
											stripe_prod.charges
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Our sync component uses an upsert API, so the data in your warehouse loaded via sync will reflect the latest state of the corresponding resource in Stripe. For example, if
										Element:code
											subscription_status
											goes from
										Element:code
											active
											to
										Element:code
											inactive
											between syncs, on its next sync that tickets status will be
										Element:code
											inactive
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source runs pull your data into the Segment Hub, and warehouse runs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources will sync with Segment every 3 hours. Depending on your Warehouses plan, we will push the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.
									Node:

											At the moment, we don’t support filtering which objects or properties get synced. If you’re interested in this feature, please let us know!
