					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					GoSquared
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to GoSquared in the format they understand.

								Getting Started
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you toggle on GoSquared in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading GoSquared‚Äôs Tracker onto your page. This means you should remove any manual integration of GoSquared.
							Element:li
								Your GoSquared Now dashboard will instantly start showing the number of visitors online, and if you‚Äôre using
							Element:code
								identify
								, users will start appearing in People Analytics.

								Mobile and Server-Side Tracking
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To track data via Segment‚Äôs mobile and server-side sources, you will need to enter a GoSquared API Key, which can be created in your
							Element:a
								GoSquared account
								. The API Key must have ‚ÄúWrite Tracking‚Äù access. All functionality is supported by mobile and server-side tracking.

								When you call

								, we call GoSquared‚Äôs

								to track a pageview. By default the Segment JavaScript snippet includes a call to
							Element:code
								track
							Element:a
								so you don‚Äôt need to add it manually.

						Node:

								When you call

								identify
							Element:a
								. Once identified with a

								identify

						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								GoSquared recognises certain traits as ‚Äúspecial‚Äù and requires all other traits to be sent under a namespace of
							Element:code
								custom
								. The Segment code handles all of this, sending recognised
							Element:a
								special properties
								and custom properties in the correct places.
