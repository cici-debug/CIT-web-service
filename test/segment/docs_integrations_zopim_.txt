					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Zopim in the format they understand.

								When you turn on Zopim in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Zopim onto your page. (This means you should remove Zopim‚Äôs snippet from your page).
							Element:li
								Since Zopim only records custom user data, no users will appear in Zopim until you
							Element:a
								your first user.

								Record Live Chat Events
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								With this integration, you can automatically record
							Element:code
								track
								events for live chat conversations. If you select this option, we‚Äôll collect the following events:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Live Chat Conversation Started
							Element:li
								Live Chat Conversation Ended
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								These events will then flow out to your other tools, so you can do things like analyze if users who chat spend more money over time.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To learn more about the live chat events you can capture with this integration, head on over to our

											I want to hide the Zopim widget on certain pages, or after a analytics.js call is made.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Currently, the best way to ensure that the Zopim widget does not load on a page is to fire a small Javascript snippet as
										Element:a
											documented here on Zopim‚Äôs site
											. To ensure that the Zopim snippet fires after the Zopim library has loaded on the page, you can either wrap the snippet in an
										Element:a
											analytics.ready()
											method with any conditional logic you‚Äôd like, or place the script in the callback of any analytics.js (
										Element:code
											.track()
											,
										Element:code
											.identify()
											, etc) call so that it will hide after that call is made.
