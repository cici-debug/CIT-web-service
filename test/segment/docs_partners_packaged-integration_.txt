					Packaged Integrations
			Node:

				Element:p
					In a packaged integration, we transform customers’ data inside our client library and send the data directly into your library running alongside the client’s application code.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					This is the integration method if your application relies on third party cookies (Advertising pixels), needs to modify the UI (A/B testing, Push Notification/In-app Messaging tools, Widgets/LiveChat), or needs to collect ambient data in the client (Heatmapping, Error & Performance Monitoring tools).
			Node:

					Please follow the documentation carefully. Segment won’t review or merge pull requests for integrations that don’t follow best practices or don’t provide any more functionality than that supported by a
				Element:a
					direct integration
					. If you have questions or get stuck, please contact partners@segment.com.

					Becoming a Packaged Partner is a four-step process. By starting or continuing this process, you agree to the

								1. Complete the integration survey
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:a
								Complete an integration survey
								so we know you’re building an integration and can support you.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Please do not move forward in the process until you hear back from our Partners team.

								2. Build and test the integration
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once you’ve received approval from the Integrations team at Segment, you’ll then need to write a custom transformation module for the appropriate Segment library. As you can host these modules in repositories yourself, you’ll have no impediment from Segment in updating and releasing new versions of your integration, and customers will specify in their build phase the version of your SDK and integration they’d like to use.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Please refer to the documentation and examples in these repositories to learn how to add a packaged integration for the appropriate library. You can also sign up for a free Segment account to see how these integrations can be turned on in the Segment user interface.

								3. Submit your technical survey for review!
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once you’ve tested your integration successfully, complete the
							Element:a
								Packaged Integration Completion Form
								. This is a short application to get all the essentials to get you onto our platform! Once you’ve completed it, our team will review your contribution and work with your team to get it released.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Due to the high volume of requests, it may take up to a week for Segment to review your application. At the end of the application, there is an option to get a link to edit your response to the form or send a copy.

								4. Private Beta
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								After we have reviewed and approved your application and integration, you’ll be placed in Private Beta. The purpose of Private Beta is to test the integration with at least 10 mutual customers or more than 20MM events. You’ll remain in Private Beta until you have fulfilled this criteria.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you have completed the requirements of Private Beta, you’ll be launched onto the platform in Public Beta. From this point on, you’ll be visible to all Segment customers in the dashboard!
