								Segment lets you make the most of your leads by automatically sending them to your business tools like CRM and email. Importantly, these integrations allow you to reach out to customers in real-time using your communication platform of choice, whether you’ve promised them a demo, a newsletter, a piece of content, or a call from a salesperson.

								Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with integrations.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								To start with, only a subset of our integrations can be used with Facebook Lead Ads (these tools are listed in the chart below). This is because Facebook only passes email as a customer identifier, and many tools require User ID. The tools listed below are those that can accept email as the customer identifier.

								Integrations that can be used with the Facebook Lead Ads Source:

								Enter the necessary credentials for the downstream tool you selected

								Log into your downstream tool and check to see that your leadsare populating and they contains all the properties you expect. The screenshot below shows what your leads would look like in Mailchimp. If all your properties are not showing up, refer to the
							Element:a
								integration docs

								Every time a Facebook user clicks on your Lead Ad and fills out your form, Segment will fire an identify call with the user’s Anonymous ID and any other traits from the form(such as name and email) as properties.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								That identify call is then routed to whichever integrations you enabled in your Facebook Lead Ads source.

								Once your Lead Ads campaign is up and running, your audience will see a form that you created in the Facebook setup process.
						Node:

								When the user submits the form, an identify call is made. From the Segment Debugger, you can look at the raw code from the identify call:

						Node:
