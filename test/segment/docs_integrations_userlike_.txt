								Record Live Chat Events
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								With this integration, you can automatically record
							Element:code
								track
								events for live chat conversations. If you select this option, we’ll collect the following events:
						Node:

							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Live Chat Conversation Started
							Element:li
								Live Chat Message Sent
							Element:li
								Live Chat Message Received
						Node:

								These events will then flow out to your other tools, so you can do things like analyze if users who chat spend more money over time.
