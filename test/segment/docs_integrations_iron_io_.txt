					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Iron.io
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Iron.io in the format they understand.

								Getting Started

								When you toggle on Iron.io in Segment, we‚Äôll start sending data to an IronMQ instance with data for your account. Currently, Iron.io supports all of the Segment methods, and will send data from any one of our libraries.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When sending data to Iron.io, we‚Äôll auto-fill a queue called ‚Äúsegment‚Äù. You can use Iron.io as a message queue buffer in front of your webhook server or internal data processing cluster. For example, if you want to analyze your data as part of an ETL process, Iron.io can act as an intermediary buffer.
