					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					Piwik
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Piwik in the format they understand.

								Getting Started
						Node:

								Track
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								We‚Äôll record a Piwik event whenever you make a
							Element:a
								call.
							Element:code
								track
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Events can be sent from the browser, your server, or our mobile SDKs. Here‚Äôs a basic
							Element:a
								example:
							Element:code
								track
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								analytics.track('Logged In');
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For this example these event attributes are sent to Piwik:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:table
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:strong
								Event Category
							Element:td
								All
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:strong
								Event Action
							Element:td
								Logged In
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								And another
							Element:a
								example, this time with all the available Piwik event parameters:
							Element:code
								track
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								analytics.track('Created Account', { category: 'Account', label: 'Premium', value: 30 })
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								That call will create a Piwik Event with these attributes:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:table
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:strong
								Event Category
							Element:td
								Account
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:strong
								Event Action
							Element:td
								Logged In
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:strong
								Event Name
							Element:td
								Premium
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:strong
								Event Value
							Element:td
								30
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For
							Element:strong
								Event Value
								you can name the event property
							Element:code
								value
								or
							Element:code
								revenue
								. We‚Äôll look for
							Element:code
								value
								first, then fall back to
							Element:code
								revenue
								.

											Custom Variables
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Piwik allows you to set
										Element:a
											custom variables
											with your pageviews and events. With Segment, you can set page-scoped custom variables with any
										Element:code
											track
											call you make with analytics.js.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Since these custom variables must be mapped to an index you define, which can change from call to call, the only way we can support these custom variables with full flexibility is to allow you to pass your map in the
										Element:code
											context.Piwik.customVars
											dictionary of each call.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To take advantage of this feature, your
										Element:code
											track
											calls should look like this:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											analytics.track('event', { property: 'property' }, { integrations: { Piwik: { customVars: { 1: ["<variableName>", "<variableValue>"], 2: ['SubscriptionId', '1234'], 3: ['PlanName', 'ENTERPRISE'] } } } }

									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:h3
											Goals
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you want to flag specific events as Piwik Goals you can do so by mapping those events in your Segment Source Integrations page under Piwik Settings.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Fill in the event on the left and the Goal ID from Piwik on the right. Then every time the event happens we‚Äôll fire Piwik‚Äôs
										Element:code
											trackGoal
											method.
