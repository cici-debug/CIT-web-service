					Take your company’s analysis to the next level by

					adding Sendgrid as a Source to Segment.
					We’ll automatically collect events like
				Element:code

				Element:code
					Delivered
					and objects such as
				Element:code
					Recipients
					or
				Element:code
					Campaigns
					and load them into your data warehouse.

								.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Choose Sendgrid.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Give the source a nickname and a schema name. The nickname will be used to designate the source in the Segment interface, and the schema name is the namespace you’ll be querying against in your warehouse. Both can be whatever you like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the source itself, like
							Element:code
								SendGrid
								for nickname and
							Element:code
								sendgrid
								or
							Element:code
								sendgrid_prod
								for the schema name.
							Element:p
							Element:img
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Note
								that you can add multiple instances if you have multiple SendGrid accounts. That’s why we allow you to customize the source’s nickname and schema name!
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Provide your API Key. In order to pull information about your contacts, we’ll make requests to SendGrid’s API with our
							Element:a
								sync component
								. You can create an API Key by navigating to
							Element:strong
								Settings > API Keys
								, clicking
							Element:strong
								General API Key
								.
							Element:p
							Element:img

								You will then be prompted to name that key and given the option to adjust the settings. We recommend providing read permissions for

											Sync
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											SendGrid has a sync component, which means we’ll make requests to their API on your behalf on a 3 hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, we’ll grab all the SendGrid objects (and their corresponding properties) according to the
										Element:a
											Collections Table
											below.
										Element:strong
											Please note
											: If you don’t use Sendgrid’s marketing campaigns features, these collections will be empty in Sendgrid and you’ll see “Zero data synced” in your runs. The webhook will still be processing activity data (but only activity data) for you though!
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Our sync component gets resources from SendGrid and forwards them to Segment using an upsert API, so the dimensional data in your warehouse loaded will reflect the latest state of the corresponding resource in SendGrid. For example, if
										Element:code
											lists.recipient_count
											goes from
										Element:code
											100
											to
										Element:code
											200
											between syncs, on its next flush to your warehouse, that tickets status will be
										Element:code
											200
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source runs pull your data into the Segment Hub, and warehouse runs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources will sync with Segment every 3 hours. Depending on your Warehouses plan, we will push the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											At the moment, we don’t support filtering which objects or properties get synced. If you’re interested in this feature, please let us know!

											Streaming
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The SendGrid source also has a streaming component which listens in real time for inbound webhooks from SendGrid’s Event Notifications and batches the events to be uploaded on your next warehouse flush. These events are only ever appended to your warehouse. Note, if you don’t use SendGrid’s marketing features, this will be the only data that we receive from SendGrid. At present, there is no way to retrieve email event history from SendGrid, so you will only have access to data that we’ve collected after you successfully enable this component of the source integration.
