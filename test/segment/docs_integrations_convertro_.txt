								Our Convertro integration let‚Äôs you track customer data from either your website data or your mobile data. When you send data via
							Element:code
								analytics.js
								we will use Convertro‚Äôs JS library to send
							Element:code
								.identify()
								and
							Element:code
								.track()
								data.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you are sending data using our mobile libraries, we will use their server to server API to send
							Element:code
								.identify()
								and
							Element:code
								.track()
								data.

														You don‚Äôt know which users are new or repeat, so you‚Äôll just send throgh
													Element:strong

														without a
													Element:code
														repeat
														property and it will get counted as a
													Element:code
														sale
														event in Convertro.
													Element:li
														You know which users are new or repeat, and when you pass through the
													Element:strong
														Completed Order
														event with a
													Element:code
														repeat
														property set to
													Element:code
														true
														or
													Element:code
														false
														we‚Äôll send through a
													Element:code
														sale.repeat
														or
													Element:code
														sale.new
														event to Convertro.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														If over the course of your using Convertro, you switch between the first and second attribution model, we provide the ability to take advantage of a
													Element:strong
														hybrid attribution model
														that will send both
													Element:code
														sale
														and
													Element:code
														sale.new
														or
													Element:code
														sale.repeat
														when you have a valid
													Element:code
														repeat
														property on the
													Element:strong
														Completed Order
														event. This is necessary to combine the models and data from your old
													Element:code
														sale
														event with the new
													Element:code
														sale.new
														and
													Element:code
														sale.repeat
														events.

								Using Mobile Libraries
						Node:

								In order for your mobile data to flow to Convertro, you want to first insert your Convertro

								Domain
								into your integration settings.
						Node:

								Important
								: Convertro requires your

								Device ID
								for all API calls. Our mobile libraries automatically collect this value from your device so you do not need to worry about it. Just don‚Äôt overwrite your

						Node:

								Convertro does not accept any user traits ‚Äì meaning that

								When you call

								event_type
								as the name of your event. If you send a
							Element:code
								revenue
								property, we will send that as the
							Element:code
								event_value
								(
							Element:code
								Completed Order
								or
							Element:code
								Order Completed
								events will use the

								total
								). The

								event_value
								will be sent as
