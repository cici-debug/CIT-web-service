					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					ClientSuccess
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to ClientSuccess in the format they understand.

								If your engineers have already setup Segment, adding Segment data to ClientSuccess is straightforward. All you need to do is turn on the integration.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To turn on the integration, do the following:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
								Go to the Segment integrations dashboard and toggle on the ClientSuccess integration.
							Element:li
								Add your
							Element:code
								ClientSuccess Source Id
								and
							Element:code
								ClientSuccess API Key
								(these can be found within ClientSuccess under the top right menu, Apps & Integrations > Usage).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Note:
								Because ClientSuccess focuses on group level events, you must pass group information before your events will show up. If you turn on the ClientSuccess integration in Segment and don’t see events in ClientSuccess after 24 hours, it may be that your engineers need to send group information to Segment using Segment’s
							Element:code
								group
								call.

								ClientSuccess supports the

								methods of Segment.
						Node:

								The

								method is required for any data to stick in ClientSuccess. Any

								track
								and
							Element:code
								page
								events fired before the
							Element:code
								group
								method is called for a particular user, will be lost.

								Identify
						Node:

							Element:p
								When you
							Element:code
								identify
								a user, Segment will pass that user’s information to ClientSuccess with
							Element:code
								userId
								as an external user Id for ClientSuccess usage. ClientSuccess uses the following of Segment’s standard user profile fields (in parentheses):
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:code
								firstName
								(
							Element:code
								first_name
								)
							Element:li
							Element:code
								lastName
								(
							Element:code
								last_name
								)
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2

								All other traits will be sent to ClientSuccess as custom attributes and may be ignored.

								as the id and

								as the group name. Both
