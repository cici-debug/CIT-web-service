					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					AdRoll
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to AdRoll in the format they understand.

								Important:
								On any page in which you‚Äôd like to send events to AdRoll, you must be sure to make a
							Element:a
								call, otherwise your other events (track, identify) won‚Äôt ever get sent to AdRoll. Page calls are included in the analytics.js snippet, so by default you should be fine, unless you‚Äôve manually removed the page call from your analytics.js snippet.

								As with all integrations, you‚Äôll use

								to set a

							Element:code
								userId
								. Once a
							Element:code
								userId
								is set we will pass it to Adroll each time a
							Element:a
								call is made. If you pass an
							Element:code
								track
							Element:code
								email
								trait, we‚Äôll send that to AdRoll by setting
							Element:code
								window.adroll_email
								to that value.

								Track
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In order to send your track calls to AdRoll for segmenting your users, get started by creating a new segment in their interface, copying the ‚ÄúSegment ID‚Äù, and pasting that following a
							Element:code
								+
								into the URL rule field.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c

								Map your client-side analytics.js event names to the corresponding AdRoll ‚ÄúSegment ID‚Äù in our integration settings pane.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:img
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								We‚Äôll fire the correct pixel accordingly to put the user into that segment whenever they trigger the event you‚Äôve chosen. Note that you will still need to map semantic events like
							Element:code
								Viewed Product
								,
							Element:code
								Added Product
								, and
							Element:code
								Order Completed
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Then, inside Adroll you can create a segment of all users doing any of those events by adding a ‚Äú+‚Äù to the segment name and adding it in the URL field, like this:

											with the segment being the snake-cased event name.

									Node:

										Element:p
											Many times this is a limitation on the tool‚Äôs detection process, where the detector is looking for a specific HTML element on your page. Our client side analytics.js library asynchronously loads the tool‚Äôs library or pixel onto the page. As such, the detection fails.
									Node:
									(type) c

											In order to confirm that the tool‚Äôs library or pixel is actually loaded onto the page, you can open up the
