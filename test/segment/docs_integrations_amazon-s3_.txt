					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Amazon S3
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Amazon S3 in the format they understand.

								Getting Started
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The Amazon S3 integration puts the raw logs of the data we‚Äôre receiving into your personal S3 bucket.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Note:
								The data is copied into your bucket every hour around :40 minute mark. You may see multiple files over a period of time depending on the volume of data copied.

								Required Steps
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Create a bucket with its region as
							Element:strong
								us-east (us-standard)
								.
							Element:li
								Create a folder ‚Äúsegment-logs‚Äù inside the bucket.
							Element:li
								Edit your bucket policy to allow Segment to copy files into the bucket:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "Version": "2008-10-17", "Id": "Policy1425281770533", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "Stmt1425281765688", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::107630771604:user/s3-copy" }, "Action": "s3:PutObject", "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/segment-logs/*" } ] }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Note:
								the
							Element:code
								Resource
								property string
							Element:strong
								must
								end with
							Element:code
								/*
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Specifically, this adds the ability to
							Element:code
								s3:PutObject
								for the Segment s3-copy user for your bucket.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can edit your bucket policy in the
							Element:a
								AWS management console
								by right-clicking the bucket and then selecting the ‚Äúedit policy‚Äù option.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Lastly, enable the Amazon S3 integration in your Segment Integrations page and put in your bucket name in the settings. It will take about an hour to start receiving data.

								Data format
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Your logs will be stored as gzipped, newline-separated JSON containing the full call information. For a list of supported properties, you‚Äôll want to check out our
							Element:a
								Spec
								docs.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The logs themselves are binned by day, and named according to the following file format:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								s3://{bucket}/segment-logs/{source-id}/{received-day}/filename.gz
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The received-day will refer to the UTC day that the files were received by our API, which makes it easy to find all calls received within a certain timeframe.

											How can I download the data from my bucket?
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											We‚Äôve had the most luck using the
										Element:a
											AWS CLI
											and writing a short script to download particular days, one at a time. We‚Äôve found AWS CLI to be significantly faster than
										Element:a
											s3cmd
											because it downloads files in parallel.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											NOTE
											: S3 transparently decompresses the files for most clients. However, if you would like to access the raw gzipped data for whatever reason, you can programmatically download the file using their
										Element:a
											SDK
											and setting
										Element:code
											ResponseContentEncoding: none
											(doesn‚Äôt work on the CLI). You can also manually remove the metadata on the file (Content-Type: text/plain and Content-Encoding: gzip) through the AWS interface, which will allow you to download the file as gzipped.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To set up AWS CLI, you‚Äôll need to first install it. There are
										Element:a
											detailed instructions here
											, or this will generally work for linux machines:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											$ sudo apt-get install awscli
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Then you‚Äôll need to configure AWS CLI with your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. You can create or find these keys in your
										Element:a
											Amazon IAM user management console
											. Then run the following command which will prompt you for the access keys:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											$ aws configure
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Now you‚Äôre ready to download some logs!
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To see a list of the most recent log folders:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											$ aws s3 ls s3://{bucket}/segment-logs/{source-id}/ | tail -10
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To download the files for a specific day:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											$ aws s3 sync s3://{bucket}/segment-logs/{source-id}/{received-day} .
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Or to download
										Element:em
											all
											files for a source:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											$ aws s3 sync s3://{bucket}/segment-logs/{source-id} .
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To put the files in a specific folder replace the
										Element:code
											.
											at the end (‚Äúcurrent directory‚Äù) with the desired directory like
										Element:code
											~/Downloads/logs
											.
