					Nudgespot Source

					Nudgespot is the easiest way to trigger emails, SMS, push notifications or in-app messages to your customers, at the right time.

					Take your company’s email analysis to the next level by
				Element:strong
					adding Nudgespot as a Source to Segment.
					We’ll automatically collect email events like
				Element:code
					Email Delivered
					and
				Element:code
					Email Opened
					, forward them to your integrations, and load them into your data warehouse.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					In your favorite BI or analytics tool, you’ll be able to analyze your email campaigns in SQL or through drag-and-drop reports. And, you’ll be able to join your Nudgespot data with the event data you’re already sending through Segment to analyze the down-funnel effects of your emails.

								If you have previously enabled sending email events via the Nudgespot integration during our beta (using a project write key), you do not need to create new Nudgespot source. Your email data will continue to flow as normal.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
							Element:p
								From your workspace’s
							Element:code
								segment.com/<your-workspace>/sources page
								, click
							Element:code
								Add source
								.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Choose Nudgespot.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Give the Source a nickname and a schema name. The nickname will be used to designate the Source in the Segment interface, and the schema name is the namespace you’ll be querying against in your warehouse. You can name them however you’d like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the Source itself, like
							Element:code
								Nudgespot
								for nickname and
							Element:code
								nudgespot
								for the schema name.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								The next page (“Overview”) will surface your
							Element:strong
								Segment write key for Nudgespot.
								Copy this write key.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								To finish the setup, you’ll have to go into your Nudgespot account and enter this Segment write key in their integrations settings. Find the right place in Nudgespot in Setup > Send Email Events to Segment.com.

								In Segment, click into your Nudgespot Source in
							Element:code
								segment.com/<your-workspace>/sources
								. From there you’ll be able to add Integrations and Warehouses where you want to see email events.
						Node:

								That’s it! As you send emails, events will now be sent to your integrations and automatically loaded into any warehouses you have enabled.

								Stream
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Nudgespot uses our stream Source component to send Segment email events. It uses a server-side
							Element:code
								track
								method to send data to Segment. These events are then available in any integration that accepts server-side events, and available in a schema in your data warehouse, so you can query via SQL.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The default behavior is for Nudgespot to pass the
							Element:code
								userId
								associated with the email recipient as the
							Element:code
								userId
								. There are cases in which Nudgespot does not have an associated
							Element:code
								userId
								, in which case the email address will be passed in as the
							Element:code
								anonymousId
								.

								Collections are the groupings of data we pull from your Source. In your warehouse, each collection gets its own table, as well as a

								table that aggregates all the events into a single table.
