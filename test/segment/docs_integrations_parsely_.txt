					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Parsely
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Parsely in the format they understand.

								When you toggle on Parsely for a website in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Parsley‚Äôs javascript onto your page. This means you should remove Parsely‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Parsely will automatically start recording data.

								Parsely is substantially more useful when you to implement JSON-LD metadata across your website:

								Follow the instructions on the Parsely sheet on the integrations page for adding the packaged Parsely SDK (a simple one-liner to add to your Podfile).

								After you build and release to the app store, we‚Äôll automatically start translating and sending your data to Parsely.

									Node:

										Element:p
											If you enable Dynamic Tracking, Segment will disable Parsely autotracking and instead explicitly proxy your

											page()
											calls to Parsely. This feature is recommended if you want Segment to pass additional pageview metadata collected with your
										Element:code
											.page()
											properties through to Parsely.

											If you enable In-Pixel Metadata, Segment will map page properties to Parsely‚Äôs

											format, allowing you to eschew their out-of-band metadata crawling. This has tradeoffs and is not the recommended approach‚Äî please be sure to check with your Parsely rep prior to enabling this setting. Requires Dynamic Tracking to be set to
