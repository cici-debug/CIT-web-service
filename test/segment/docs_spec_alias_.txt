					Spec: Alias
			Node:

				Element:p
					The
				Element:code
					alias
					method is used to merge two user identities, effectively connecting two sets of user data as one. This is an advanced method, but it is required to manage user identities successfully in some of our integrations.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Since this is our most advanced method we have added sections to each docs page for integrations that use it:

				Element:li
				Element:a
					KISSmetrics

				Element:p
					Here’s the payload of a basic
				Element:code
					alias
					call that will associate this user’s existing
				Element:code
					id
					(email address) with a new one (a database ID), with most
				Element:a
					common fields
					removed:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					{ "type": "alias", "previousId": "jen@email.com", "userId": "507f191e81" }
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					If you’re instrumenting a website, then the Anonymous ID is generated in the browser so you’ll want to call
				Element:code
					alias
					from the client-side. If you’re using a server-side session ID as the Anonymous ID, then you’ll want to alias from the server-side.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Here’s the corresponding Javascript event that would generate the above payload. If you’re using Segment’s Javascript library, we’ll automatically pass in the user’s anonymousId as previousId for you:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					analytics.alias("507f191e81");
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Beyond the common fields, the
				Element:code
					alias
					call takes the following fields:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:table
				Element:tr
				Element:th
				Element:strong
					Field
				Element:th
				Element:strong
					Type
				Element:th
				Element:strong
					Description
				Element:tr
				Element:td
				Element:code
					previousId
				Element:em
					required
				Element:td
					String
				Element:td
					Previous unique identifier for the user
				Element:p
					See the
				Element:a
					Previous ID field docs

				Element:tr
				Element:td
				Element:code
					userId
				Element:em
					required
				Element:td
					String
				Element:td
					Unique identifier for the user in your database
				Element:p
					A
				Element:code
					userId
				Element:em
					or
				Element:code
					anonymousId
					is required
				Element:p

				Element:a
