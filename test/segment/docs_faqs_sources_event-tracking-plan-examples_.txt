																	SENT SOURCE DATA
															Node:
															(type) c
															(layer)5
																Element:p
																	The tricky thing with this event is that it’s unique per source, but everything else is tracked per user. So we’ll want to record a “Sent Source Data” event: once a day, for each user, for every source they’re connected with that had data sent. So a user might be an owner/collaborator on 3 sources that sent data today, in which case we’ll send 3 “Sent Source Data” events, one for each of those sources. We still want to differentiate workspace stuff from user account stuff.
