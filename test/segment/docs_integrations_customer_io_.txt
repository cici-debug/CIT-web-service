					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Customer.io
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Customer.io in the format they understand.
			Node:

				Element:p
					Our Customer.io integration code is all open-source on GitHub if you want to check it out:
				Element:a
					Javascript
					,
				Element:a

					(iOS and Android work via the server integration).

								Getting Started
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you turn on Customer.io in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Customer.io‚Äôs track.js onto your page. This means you should remove Customer.io‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Since Customer.io only records custom events and custom user data, no events or users will appear in Customer.io until you start using the API outlined below.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To finish the setup, you‚Äôll have to go into your Customer.io account and enter your Segment write key in their integrations settings. Find the right place in Customer.io by clicking Settings > Integrations > Segment.

								Identify
						Node:

							Element:p
								When you call
							Element:a
								on analytics.js, we call
							Element:code
								identify
							Element:a
								on Customer.io. For an email to appear in the People view, you must provide an email as a trait labeled
							Element:code
								identify
							Element:code
								email
								.
						Node:

								When you call
							Element:a
								from one of our server-side languages, we‚Äôll create/update a customer with any

							Element:code
								traits.email

								To unsubscribe a user, simply pass in
							Element:code
								user_id
								,
							Element:code
								email
								and
							Element:code
								unsubscribed
								in an
							Element:code
								identify
								event. Be sure the
							Element:code
								user_id
								and
							Element:code
								email
								match the values in Customer.io, which you can find in the
							Element:strong
								overview
								section under the
							Element:strong
								attributes
								column within an individual user‚Äôs view in the Customer.io dashboard. Here is an example of how to unsubscribe a user in
							Element:code
								analytics-ruby
								:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								Analytics.identify( user_id: 'dswkg5w', traits: { email: 'testing-dswkg5w@segment.com', unsubscribed: true } )

								Note:
								if you are using our
							Element:a
								HTTP API
								to send a bunch of
							Element:code
								identify
								calls to Customer.io at once, make sure you throttle the
							Element:code
								import
								to 100-200 requests per second.
