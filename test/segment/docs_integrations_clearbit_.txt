					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Clearbit
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Clearbit in the format they understand.

					Our Clearbit integration code is open-source on GitHub if you want to

					check it out

											When you call

											identify
											with a
										Element:code
											userId
											and
										Element:code
											email
											trait, we‚Äôll send the Segment spec to Clearbit so that they can enrich your data. Once Clearbit enriches your data, they will send back a new
										Element:code
											identify
											call to your Segment source (Clearbit will have access to your
										Element:code
											writeKey
											) with additional traits! That way you can get Clearbit enriched data into your other enabled downstream Segment integrations or Warehouses such as Redshift!

											You must enter the
										Element:em
											secret key
											, not the
										Element:em
											public key
											Clearbit provides.
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:p
											In addition, a
										Element:code
											trait.email
											must be present for Clearbit to function properly.

											To verify that the integration has been set up correctly, check the Debugger section of your Segment Source. Assuming everything has been set up correctly, you should start seeing Clearbit data populate in the
										Element:code
											identify
											events ‚Äì click on the specific event you‚Äôre interested in to see Clearbit traits. These traits will now be available to other Segment integrations in your account. Notice that all Clearbit traits are prefixed with
										Element:code
											clearbit_
											to ensure they don‚Äôt conflict with existing traits.
