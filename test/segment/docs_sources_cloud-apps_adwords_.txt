								From your workspace’s

								.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Choose AdWords.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Give the source a nickname and a schema name. The nickname will be used to designate the source in the Segment interface, and the schema name is the namespace you’ll be querying against in your warehouse. Both can be whatever you like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the source itself, like
							Element:code
								AdWords
								for nickname and
							Element:code
								adwords
								,
							Element:code
								google_adwords
								, or
							Element:code
								adwords_usa
								for the schema name.

											Sync
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											AdWords has a sync component, which means we’ll make requests to their API on your behalf on a 3 hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, we’ll grab all the Adwords objects (and their corresponding properties) according to the Collections table below. The objects will be written into a separate schema, corresponding to the source instance’s schema name you designated upon creation. For example, if you went with
										Element:code
											adwords
											, the
										Element:code
											ads
											collection will be accessible at
										Element:code
											adwords.ads
											in SQL.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Our sync component uses an upsert API, so the data in your warehouse loaded via sync will reflect the latest state of the corresponding resource in AdWords. For example, if
										Element:code
											budget
											from
										Element:code
											0
											to
										Element:code
											100
											between syncs, on its next sync that tickets status will be
										Element:code
											100
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source runs pull your data into the Segment Hub, and warehouse runs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources will sync with Segment every 3 hours. Depending on your Warehouses plan, we will push the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.

								When setting up your AdWords Source, you may notice that we don’t list all AdWords accounts your Google user can view. This is because AdWords API does not expose a list of “managed” or sub-accounts to non-administrator via the API. That said, if you have read permissions to the account, you can enter your AdWords Customer ID directly. For more information about finding your AdWords Customer ID, see
							Element:a
