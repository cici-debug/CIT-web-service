					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Drift in the format they understand.

								If you‚Äôre using analytics.js and identify users by default, Drift will work automatically. If you don‚Äôt have analytics.js setup, after enabling the Drift integration in Segment, you must identify users in order for Drift to display in your product.

								When you

								If you do not pass a

								Keep in mind, we

								When you send a

								call where the

								companyId
								is set to the
							Element:code
								groupId
								and the traits are set to the attributes, and another to map the user to that company.
