								When you toggle on Clicky in Segment, this is what happens:

								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading clicky.js onto your page. This means you should remove Clicky‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Clicky will start automatically collecting data on your site.
