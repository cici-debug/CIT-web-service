					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					Crazy Egg
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Crazy Egg in the format they understand.

								Getting Started

								When you toggle on Crazy Egg in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading crazyegg.js onto your page. This means you should remove Crazy Egg‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Crazy Egg will automatically start recording heatmap data. Go to
							Element:a
								Crazy Egg
								to choose which pages you want heatmaps of.
							Element:li
								Note that it may take 24 - 48 hours for initial data to show up in Crazy Egg.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Since Crazy Egg only records data about mouse clicks and scrolls, it does not collect any of the data represented by our API.

											Script unverified or undetected by third-party tool
									Node:
									(type) c

										Element:p
											Many times this is a limitation on the tool‚Äôs detection process, where the detector is looking for a specific HTML element on your page. Our client side analytics.js library asynchronously loads the tool‚Äôs library or pixel onto the page. As such, the detection fails.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In order to confirm that the tool‚Äôs library or pixel is actually loaded onto the page, you can open up the
										Element:a
											javascript console
											and go to the network tab when the page is loading.
