					Facebook Offline Conversions Integration
			Node:

				Element:p
					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Facebook Offline Conversions
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Facebook Offline Conversions in the format they understand.

								Getting Started
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In order to send your server side
							Element:code
								.track()
								events as offline conversions to Facebook’s Offline Event Sets, you must first authorize Segment to send data on your behalf by connecting through our OAuth. You can do so in your integration settings page:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								By doing so, we will ask for
							Element:code
								ads_management
								and
							Element:code
								public_profile
								access scopes which will allow Segment to have proper permissions to send offline events to your Event Sets. You can read more about Facebook’s
							Element:a
								access and authentication
								if you would like to know exactly what these scopes allow.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								IMPORTANT
								: Note that the Segment user that is OAuthing
							Element:strong
								MUST
								have admin access in your company’s Facebook Business Manager account. Otherwise, the authorization will fail.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once you complete the OAuth flow, you should be connected.

								Note
								: Once we retrieve your access token, they should not expire. However, if for whatever reason you are not seeing conversions come through you should check your integration settings and you should reauthorize.

								Additional Prerequisite Configurations
						Node:

								Before you can activate the integration, there are a few event mappings you should set up to get your data flowing.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Since we do not want to send unwanted
							Element:code
								.track()
								events as conversions, you
							Element:strong
								MUST
								map the name of every Segment
							Element:code
								.track()
								event that you’d like to send and the corresponding ID of the Event Set where you want to send the conversions to.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can find Facebook Offline Event Set ID by going to your
							Element:strong
								Offline Events
								page in your Facebok
							Element:strong
								Business Manager
								account and clicking the desired Offline Event Set here:

								Attribution and “Match Keys”
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Facebook requires that you send at least
							Element:em
								one
							Element:code
								match_key
								in order for them to attribute which Facebook user should be tied to a conversion. The more user information you send with your
							Element:code
								.track()
								calls, the better the accuracy of Facebook’s attribution. Once Facebook has successfully attributed a conversion for a given user, they will store the mapping between the
							Element:code
								userId
								to the rest of
							Element:code
								match_keys
								such as the
							Element:code
								email
								address for all future conversions.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Since
							Element:code
								.track()
								events by default do not require you to send user metadata, it is still possible for us to send a conversion as long as you send us a
							Element:code
								userId
								(which we map to Facebook’s
							Element:code
								extern_id
								). However, for better attribution results, we recommend you send as much applicable user data through
							Element:code
								context.traits
								as shown in the mapping table below:

								that include personally identifiable data in compliance with Facebook’s privacy requirements.

								Keep in mind that Facebook’s furthest possible attribution window is 28 days. It is recommended that you send your server side
