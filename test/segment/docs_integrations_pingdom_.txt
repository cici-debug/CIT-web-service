					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Pingdom in the format they understand.

								Getting Started
						Node:

								When you toggle on Pingdom in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Pingdom‚Äôs javascript onto your page. This means you should remove Pingdom‚Äôs snippet from your page if had previously put it there.
							Element:li
								Pingdom will automatically start recording page load times. Go to
							Element:a
								Pingdom
								to view your page load performance data.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Since Pingdom only records data about page load performance, it does not collect any of the data represented by our API.
