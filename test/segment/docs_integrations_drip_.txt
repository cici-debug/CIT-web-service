					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Drip
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Drip in the format they understand.

					Our Drip integration code is all open-source on GitHub if you want to check it out:

								Getting Started
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you toggle on Drip in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Drip‚Äôs track.js onto your page. This means you should remove Drip‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Since Drip only records custom events and custom user data, no events or users will appear in Drip until you start using the API outlined below.

								Identify
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you call
							Element:a
								on analytics.js, we call
							Element:code
								identify
							Element:a
								on Drip and pass through all of the user traits that were included on that call. You must pass email as a trait to identify the user to Drip. Note that if you want to do cross-domain tracking, after you‚Äôve enabled it in the Drip UI, you‚Äôll need to pass
							Element:code
								identify
							Element:code
								email
								as a trait on the identify call on both domains.

								Track
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you call
							Element:a
								, we‚Äôll send the event to Drip with the event
							Element:code
								track
							Element:code
								name
								and all
							Element:code
								properties
								that you specified. If you include
							Element:code
								revenue
								as a property, it will get passed to Drip as the conversion value of this event.

							Element:strong
								Note:
						Node:

							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:p
								If you are sending custom server side events, you must include an
							Element:code
								email
								property of the user that the event belongs to. Additionally, you will want to convert spaces to underscores in attribute names before sending it over to Drip. Otherwise, Drip‚Äôs API will return an error.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Only conversions that are attributed to a Drip email delivery will show on the conversions dashboard page.
