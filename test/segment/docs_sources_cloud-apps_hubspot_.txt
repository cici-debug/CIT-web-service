					Take your company’s analysis to the next level by
				Element:strong
					adding Hubspot as a Source to Segment.
					We’ll automatically collect events like
				Element:code
					Form Submissions
					and objects such as
				Element:code
					Contacts
					or
				Element:code
					Email Campaigns
					and load them into your data warehouse.

							Element:p
								From your workspace’s
							Element:code
								/sources
								page, click
							Element:code
								add source
								.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Choose Hubspot.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Give the source a nickname and a schema name. The nickname will be used to designate the source in the Segment interface, and the schema name is the namespace you’ll be querying against in your warehouse. Both can be whatever you like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the source itself, like
							Element:code
								Hubspot
								for nickname and
							Element:code
								hubspot
								,
							Element:code
								hub
								, or
							Element:code
								hubspot_prod
								for the schema name.
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Note
								that you can add multiple instances if you have multiple Hubspot accounts. That’s why we allow you to customize the source’s nickname and schema name!
							Element:p
							Element:img
							Element:li

								Finally, connect an account with
							Element:strong
								admin API permissions
								to access your Hubspot data. This account should be an active user on a Professional or Enterprise plan. Check out
							Element:a
								Hubspot’s docs on how to get your API Key

								Voila! We’ll begin syncing your HubSpot data into Segment momentarily, and it will be written to your warehouse at your next Warehouse run.

											Sync
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Hubspot has a sync component, which means we’ll make requests to
										Element:a
											their API
											on your behalf on a 3 hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, we’ll grab all the Hubspot objects (and their corresponding properties) according to the collections table below. The objects will be written into a designated schema corresponding to the source instance’s schema name you designated upon creation. For example, if you went with
										Element:code
											hubspot_prod
											, the
										Element:code
											contacts
											collection will be accessible at
										Element:code
											hubspot_prod.contacts
											in SQL.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Our sync component uses an
										Element:strong
											upsert
											API, so the data in your warehouse loaded via sync will reflect the
										Element:strong
											latest
											state of the corresponding resource in Hubspot. For example, if
										Element:code
											lead_status
											from
										Element:code
											active
											to
										Element:code
											inactive
											between syncs, on its next sync that tickets status will be
										Element:code
											inactive
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source runs pull your data into the Segment Hub, and warehouse runs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources will sync with Segment every 3 hours. Depending on your Warehouses plan, we will push the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.
									Node:
									(type) c

											At the moment, we don’t support filtering which objects or properties get synced. If you’re interested in this feature, please let us know!

											and

											email_subscription_event_changes
											. If you need more, just let us know, and we’ll arrange a one-off run to pull further history.
