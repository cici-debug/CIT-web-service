				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Smyte in the format they understand.

					Smyte works with events from both your clients and your server, so you don‚Äôt need to be using a particular Segment SDK, however, the more data you can provide Smyte from as many platforms as you can, the more effective our technology becomes.
