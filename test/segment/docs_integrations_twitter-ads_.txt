								Getting Started
						Node:

							Element:p
								From your Segment Integrations page click on Twitter Ads. Twitter Ads can track conversions in two ways. You can opt to use their newest
							Element:strong
								Universal Website Tag
								or their
							Element:strong
								Single Event Website Tag
								. You could also use both types of tags on the same page.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you want to use the universal tag, all you have to do is enter your
							Element:strong
								Universal Website Tag Pixel ID
								in the settings and create your conversion events inside Twitter’s UI. The
							Element:strong
								Universal Website Tag
								will map to any Segment event listed in the table
							Element:a
								Advanced Conversion Tracking/Dynamic Ads
								. You can find this pixel ID in Twitter’s snippet that is generated for you after making a new Universal Conversion Event:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you’d like to use the
							Element:strong
								Single Event Website Tags
								, you must map the Segment events to your tags’ respective conversion pixel IDs. The
							Element:strong
								Single Event Website Tag
								is good to use if your event names do not match the Segment supported events with the
							Element:strong
								Universal Website Tag
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Note that Twitter Ads only works with our client-side javascript library
							Element:code
								analytics.js
								as it requires its script or pixel to be loaded onto your website.

								Page
						Node:

								If you are using the
							Element:strong
								Universal Website Tag
								, when you call
							Element:code
								.page()
								we will fire a standard pageview event using Twitter’s JS library:
							Element:code
								window.twq('track', 'PageView')
								as seen in their auto generated snippet.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you are only using
							Element:strong
								Single Event Website Tags
								, we will load their standard pageview pixel with default query values (
							Element:code
								revenue: 0, quantity: 0
								) given that you have provided the
							Element:strong
								Page Pixel
								in your Segment settings for Twitter Ads.

											Each time you
										Element:a
											an event from the browser with our Twitter Ads integration enabled we compare the event name to the events you have mapped to
										Element:code
											track
										Element:strong
											Twitter Conversion IDs
											inside of Segment. If the event being tracked corresponds to a Twitter conversion, a Twitter conversion pixel will be loaded on that page with the ID that you mapped it to.
									Node:

										Element:p
											You can find your conversion pixel IDs after you create the single conversion event inside Twitter:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3

											For example, if your mapping in Segment looks like this:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Then everytime you make this

										Element:code
											track
									Node:

										Element:pre
										Element:code
											analytics.track('Signed Up', { quantity: 1, revenue: 10 });
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											We will fire a Twitter conversion pixel for you with a
										Element:strong
											Twitter Conversion ID
											of
										Element:code
											28j3fo
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											It doesn’t matter what you call the conversion inside of Twitter Ads as long as you paste your
										Element:strong
											Twitter Conversion ID
											next to the right event in Segment.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you include
										Element:code
											properties.quantity
											and
										Element:code

											with your events, we will send that along as parameters of the conversion tag. If these two properties are not provided, we will send the two parameters as
										Element:code
											0
											.
									Node:
									(type) c

											Thus the example
