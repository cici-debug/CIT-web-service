								variation_id
								and build an internal hierarchy which we use to enhance the prediction of the user behavior during an experiment. To support experiments within predictions, the ‘experiment_id’ (required) and the
							Element:code
								variation_id
								(optional) can be sent. If
							Element:code
								experiment_id
								is not sent, we simply save
							Element:code

											Geohashes are a geocoding system that converts longitude and latitude values to hashes. Geohashes can be an important tool in protecting your user’s privacy. Depending on the precision a coordinate is transitioned to a geospatial square. Geohashes are useful for many things including, for example, to tag the location of users while protecting their privacy. If you want to know more about geohashes feel free to reach out to us. Implementations of en/decoding Geohashes are freely available, and widely used in the scientific community.

											Perfect Moment & Timing Automation
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Based on the data we receive, we can calculate the perfect moment to engage your users. For example, we enable you to build a marketing campaign, and schedule it to be sent at the exact point in time which she is likely to read and engage with the message. This ability can greatly increase engagement and conversion rates in marketing campaigns.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you want to have more control, you can choose to send emails or push notification at a fixed time of day, in your user’s time zone or in your local timezone. We strongly recommend using Perfect Moment when you are starting a campaign.
