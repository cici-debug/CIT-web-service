								Getting Started
						Node:

								When you toggle on TV Squared in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading TV Squared‚Äôs javascript onto your page. This means you should remove TV Squared‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								TV Squared will start automatically recording events.

								When you call

							Element:code
								Basic Hit Tracker
								. This should be fired on every page.

								Track
						Node:

							Element:p
								When you call
							Element:a
								in Analytics.js, we call TV Squared‚Äôs
							Element:code
								track
							Element:code
								Action Tracker
								. Along with the
							Element:code
								event name
								, you can specify a dictionary of properties that will get sent to TV Squared. TV Squared
							Element:strong
								requires
							Element:code
								revenue
								,
							Element:code
								productType
								,
							Element:code
								orderId
								, and
							Element:code
								promo
								passed through each call. An example call will look like:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								analytics.track('Completed Purchase', { revenue: 42.99, promo: 'COUPON1', orderId: '12345', productType: 'Clothing' });
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Since TV Squared
							Element:strong
								requires
							Element:code
								revenue
								,
							Element:code
								promo
								,
							Element:code
								orderId
								, and
							Element:code
								productType
								on each call, you can pass in an empty string to send in an event that may not have a value for the aforementioned properties.
