					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					Nanigans
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Nanigans in the format they understand.

							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Nanigans.js onto your page. This means you should remove Nanigans‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Nanigans will start automatically collecting data on your site.

								In order for the

								For ecommerce events,(i.e.

								If the folks at Nanigans ask you pass through any custom parameters, you can map the Segment event properties to arbitrary querystring parameters as well.

								Server-Side
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								By default, if you are sending data via a mobile library, we will send the
							Element:code
								IDFA
								(iOS) or
							Element:code
								Advertising ID
								(Android) so that you can associate server side events with the anonymous users from your mobile app.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								However, if you are sending events with a server side library, you can still manually pass the
							Element:code
								IDFA
								or
							Element:code
								Advertising ID
								under
							Element:code
								context.device.advertisingId
								and we will send it along to achieve the same effect.

								Mobile
						Node:

								By default, if you send any data with either the iOS or Android library, we will send that data to Nanigans required

								endpoint.
						Node:

							Element:p
								If you‚Äôd like to send any other server side event using a server side library, you can either enable the option ‚ÄúSend Events to Mobile Endpoint‚Äù in your Nanigans settings. However, this means that ALL server side events sent from your server side library will be sent to the mobile endpoint.
