					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					LiveChat
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to LiveChat in the format they understand.

								Getting Started
						Node:

							Element:p
								When you toggle on LiveChat in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading LiveChat’s javascript onto your page. This means you should remove LiveChat’s snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								LiveChat’s chat box will appear on your page and you can start chatting with visitors.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								LiveChat is only supported on the client-side.

								When you call

								traits
								you provide and set them as custom variables using LiveChat’s
							Element:code
								set_custom_variables
								function. We use the
							Element:code
								userId
								you provide to
							Element:code
								identify
								as a custom variable called
							Element:code

								Record Live Chat Events
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								With this integration, you can automatically record
							Element:code
								track
								events for live chat conversations. If you select this option, we’ll collect the following events:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Live Chat Conversation Started
							Element:li
								Live Chat Conversation Ended
							Element:li
								Live Chat Message Sent
							Element:li
								Live Chat Message Received
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								These events will then flow out to your other tools, so you can do things like analyze if users who chat spend more money over time.
