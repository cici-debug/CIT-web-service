					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					Olark
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Olark in the format they understand.

								Getting Started
						Node:

								When you toggle on Olark in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Olark‚Äôs loader0.js onto your page. This means you should remove Olark‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Olark‚Äôs chat box will appear on your page, as configured in your
							Element:a
								Olark account
								, and you can start chatting with visitors.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Olark is only supported on the client side.

											If you‚Äôd like to use the native Olark Javascript functions after turning on Olark via Segment our

								Record Live Chat Events
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Using Olark through Segment gives you the ability to automatically record
							Element:code
								track
								events for live chat conversations. If you select this option, we‚Äôll collect the following events:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Live Chat Conversation Started
							Element:li
								Live Chat Message Sent
							Element:li
								Live Chat Message Received
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								These events will be sent to other tools in your stack that can accept track calls, so you can do things like analyze if users who chat spend more money over time.
