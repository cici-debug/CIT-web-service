						Node:

								The first thing you’ll want to do is to

							Element:code
								identify
						Node:

						Node:

								,

								and
							Element:code

								. Any other traits will instead be sent to Kahuna as

						Node:

								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Whenever you call track, we’ll send an event to Kahuna with the event name and a unix timestamp. We will also pass through any properties of the event. If
							Element:code
								properties.quantity
								and
							Element:code
								properties.revenue
								are set, then we will send the event name as well as count and value. For value, we will first multiply
							Element:code
								properties.revenue
								by
							Element:code
								100
								before sending to Kahuna since Kahuna tracks value in cents not dollars.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2

							Element:strong
								Note:
								We will flatten any compound objects such as nested objects or arrays. We will also strip any properties that have values of
							Element:code
								null
								since Kahuna’s API does not support these values. Lastly, just like the
							Element:code
								identify
								call, we will send any relevant device parameters we can send based off the context of the call.
