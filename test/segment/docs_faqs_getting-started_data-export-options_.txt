					There are a few ways to export your Segment data. Segment
				Element:a
					Business customers
					have the most data flexibility, but our self-service customers also have options.

														Replay
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														When you want to trial or start using a new vendor, Segment can replay your timestamped, historical data so it’s like you’ve been using that app all along.

												Node:

														Replay works for all server-side integrations that have or accept timestamp, including our Amazon S3 integration, so you can get all your data history since the first event you sent to Segment.

														All customers can connect a data warehouse to Segment – Free and Team customers can connect one, while Business customers can connect as many as they need. We translate and load your raw data logs into your warehouse for more powerful analysis in SQL.

												Node:

														We store all your API calls as line-separated JSON objects in Amazon S3. If you enable Amazon S3 in your integrations dashboard, we will copy the same data to your own S3 bucket. The data copied will only include data sent to Segment after you turn on the integration. Read our
													Element:a
														Amazon S3 docs
														to learn more about how we structure that data.

														Webhooks
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														You can use our webhooks integration to fire off requests in realtime to an endpoint that you would need to spin up and manage on your side. This is basically re-creating how our business system works but takes a bit of work on your side. If your event volume is high it can be difficult to keep a server up to receive those messages in realtime.

														Iron.io
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Another one of our integrations similar to webhooks, but they will manage the message queue and allow you to run scripts on your data before routing it to another end point. Again this is similar to what Segment does for our business customers, but will require a decent amount of work from your team, however it will be much more reliable if your event volume gets high.

														3rd Party Reporting APIs
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														This option is the most restrictive but might be the easiest if you need only basic basic data to be exported. A few examples would be to use the reporting APIs
													Element:a
														Clicky
														or
													Element:a
														Google Analytics
														provide (after turning those tools on in Segment and sending them data). Those APIs aren’t super flexible and you won’t see all the data from Segment, but for basic metrics they should work. One tool that’s a bit more flexible when it comes to a reporting API is
													Element:a
														Keen.io
														, which is also available on the Segment platform.
