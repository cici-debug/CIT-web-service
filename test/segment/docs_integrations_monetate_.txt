											Because the Monetate integration needs to be on the page right away, Segment can‚Äôt add it for you. That means you‚Äôll need to put the Monetate javascript snippet on the page. Pop over to Monetate and in Settings > Integration > Tag you‚Äôll find their snippet.

											To get started with Monetate and Segment, just toggle on the Monetate integration on your Segment

											. If you‚Äôve already copied the Monetate script tag onto your page, you‚Äôre ready to go!

											The script looks something like this:

										Element:pre
										Element:code
											<script type="text/javascript"> var monetateT = new Date().getTime(); (function() { var p = document.location.protocol; if (p == "http:" || p == "https:") { var m = document.createElement("script"); m.type = "text/javascript"; m.src = (p == "https:" ? "https://s" : "http://") + "e.monetate.net/js/2/[siteId]/p/[domain]/entry.js"; var e = document.createElement("div"); e.appendChild(m); document.write(e.innerHTML); } })(); </script>
									Node:

											Include this snippet on every page you want to run experiments on and track as a goal. This snippet will not change. This separate script is required because Monetate alters the page, if it were loaded async the alterations may cause unappealing results.
