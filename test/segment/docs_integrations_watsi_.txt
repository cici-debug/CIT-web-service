					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Watsi
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Watsi in the format they understand.

					The Watsi integration gives you the ability to create a trigger which will send a Watsi gift card to your users based on your Segment events!

					Getting Started
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					First of all, make sure you have a
				Element:a
					Watsi
					account. Once you have an account, you must have access to this integration. To get access, please email Watsi at connect@watsi.org with your account information, and we‚Äôll turn on this feature on for you.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Now we can go to the
				Element:a
					Segment settings
					page - you need to be logged in to view it - where you will see a few tabs:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
				Element:strong
					Account Information
					- Here is where you can find your Api Auth Token and your email, the two necessary fields for enabling Watsi as a Segment integration (more on that below).
				Element:li
				Element:strong
					Activity Log
					- Here is where you will see a list of actions that Watsi has taken because of the integration. You will be able to keep track of successful triggers and also get insights as to any failures you might receive.
				Element:li
				Element:strong
					Segment Events
					- In this pane, you can create, edit, and delete your custom triggers that Watsi will attempt to send gift cards for.

								Here you will see a list of events you have created triggers for. In this example, I have created a trigger for a Sign Up event that when read by Watsi will send a Gift Card to the recipient (presumably someone who signs up for your service) for $10. Let‚Äôs add a new trigger for someone upgrading their accounts.

								Notice that Watsi can currently only create triggers based on Segment
							Element:code
								track
								calls.Finally, click
							Element:code
								Save
								, and your trigger will be made.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								That‚Äôs pretty much all there is to set up on the Watsi side of this. However, no gift cards are being sent yet! That‚Äôs because we haven‚Äôt turned on the Watsi Segment integration yet. Head over to the Segment dashboard and look at the Watsi Integration:

						(type) c

						Node:

								We‚Äôre going to want to add our API Auth Token and email that we saw earlier and click on
							Element:code
								Enable Integration
								. Now things should be good to go. Let‚Äôs talk about what the events should look like.

								Track
						Node:

								When you call

								track
								, Segment will send the event to Watsi with the

								event name
								and
							Element:code
								properties
								you provide. For Watsi‚Äôs integration, we accept any track event, but we only do something for the triggers you‚Äôve set above. Let‚Äôs say you named the event
