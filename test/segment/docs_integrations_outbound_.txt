			Node:

				Element:p
					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Outbound
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Outbound in the format they understand.

								Getting Started
						Node:

							Element:p
								When you toggle on Outbound in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start sending all your analytics data to Segment’s servers, where we’ll send the data onwards to Outbound.
							Element:li
								Your Outbound real-time feed will start showing visitor data.
						Node:

							Element:p
								If you plan on having both a production and development environment, you will want enter your Outbound API keys into the corresponding Segment sources.
						Node:

								Outbound is supported on the client-side, server-side and on mobile.

								Identify
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Outbound needs to identify users and their data to track who we should message. Segment will pass your UserID and any traits that you store on that user to Outbound. (Note: Segment refers to user data as “traits”; Outbound refers to user data as “attributes”.)
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								analytics.identify({ userId: '019mr8mf4r', traits: { name: 'Michael Bolton', email: 'mbolton@initech.com', phone: '1234567890', }, context: { device: { type: "ios", token: 'XXXYYYZZZ' }}});
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Outbound has specific first-class traits that are used to send and customize messages on various channels:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								name (maps to Outbound’s first_name and last_name attributes) recommended for targeted copy.
							Element:li
								email (maps to Outbound’s email attribute) required for email campaigns
							Element:li
								phone (maps to Outbound’s phone_number attribute) for sms & voice campaigns
							Element:li
								context.device.token (maps to Outbound’s apns or gcm attributes) for iOS and Android Push.
							Element:li
								timezone (maps to Outbound’s timezone attribute) recommended to use Outbound’s time of day message delivery feature (note - Outbound only accepts Olson name values) These are automatically collected if you’re using Segment’s mobile SDKs

								Alias
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Outbound allows aliasing, which enables you to join an anonymous pre-signup ID with a post-signup userID. When you send an identify call that has an anonymous user, that user will be created using the anonymous id you supply in the identify call. Later, when you want to update this anonymous user’s id to their actual id, you can do so by using Segment’s alias method. The following is an example alias call from Segment’s Analytics.js library:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								analytics.alias('019mr8mf4r');

								Track
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Events and their properties are used to trigger and customize message campaigns within Outbound:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								analytics.track('Signed Up', { plan: 'Startup', source: 'Analytics Academy' });
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Outbound’s campaign filters allow you to target specific segments of users based on events, event properties, and attributes. Having specific events and attributes allow you to better target your audiences with custom messaging:

								Once a user is sent a message, you will often want to measure whether or not they reach a specific goal. Events are used to calculate if users reach these goals:
