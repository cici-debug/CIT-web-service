					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source

					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Bugsnag in the format they understand.

								Getting Started
						Node:

							Element:p
								To get started with Bugsnag and Segment, you‚Äôll want to integrate your mobile app with our
							Element:a
								iOS
								or
							Element:a
								Android
								sources.
						Node:

								Once a Segment library is integrated with your app, toggle Bugsnag on in your Segment integrations page, and add your
							Element:strong
								API Key
								, which you can find in your
							Element:a
								Bugsnag app settings
								. These new settings will take up to an hour to propogate to all of your existing users. Or if you just added the iOS or Android library to your app code, it‚Äôll be instanteneous!

								Bugsnag can show you the

								and

								traits
								in the Users tab of each error. This can help you figure out what‚Äôs causing the error. You can record this data with the
							Element:a
								method. You should make the
							Element:code
								identify
							Element:a
								call as soon as you know the user‚Äôs identity. This usually happens after they log in or sign up.
