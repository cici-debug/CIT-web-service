					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Planhat
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Planhat in the format they understand.

								When you

							Element:code
								userId
								as Planhat’s External User ID. Segment’s special traits recognized as Planhat’s standard contact profile fields (in parentheses) are:

								In addition, all calls will get Segment as ‘source’.

								If the
							Element:code
								userId
								or
							Element:code
								traits.email
								matches an existing Contact in Planhat the Identify-call will automatically be associated with that Contact. Otherwise a new Contact will be created in Planhat. New Contacts received from Segment can either be discarded or manually assigned to a Customer profile in Planhat.
