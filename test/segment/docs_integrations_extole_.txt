								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Extole‚Äôs
							Element:code
								core.js
								onto your page. This means you should remove Extole‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Because Extole tracks custom user data, no data will appear in Extole until you
							Element:a
								the current user.
