					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Help Scout in the format they understand.

								Getting Started

								When you toggle on HelpScout in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start sending your identify data back to Segment, where we‚Äôll forward the data to the HelpScout REST API.
							Element:li
								Since HelpScout only records custom user data, no events or users will appear in HelpScout until you start using the API outlined below.
						Node:

								HelpScout is supported on the client-side and server-side.
