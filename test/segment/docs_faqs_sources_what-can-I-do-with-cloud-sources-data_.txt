											In general, we’ve focused on pulling all of the collections directly related to the customer experience. We do not automatically pull all collections available from a partner API, since many of them aren’t relevant to the customer journey. You can see a list the collections we pull in the docs
										Element:a
											for each cloud source
											. Each collection reflects a table in your database.
