								Bing Ads will record all of your pageviews and events sent via
							Element:code
								page
								and
							Element:code
								track
								, and then you can use that data to create custom goals and conversions in the Bing Ads interface.
						Node:

							Element:p
								We recommend creating a single Tag in Bing Ads for all the goals in your source. We‚Äôll use that Tag ID load the correct tag onto the page.

											Script unverified or undetected by third-party tool
									Node:

										Element:p
											Many times this is a limitation on the tool‚Äôs detection process, where the detector is looking for a specific HTML element on your page. Our client side analytics.js library asynchronously loads the tool‚Äôs library or pixel onto the page. As such, the detection fails.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In order to confirm that the tool‚Äôs library or pixel is actually loaded onto the page, you can open up the
										Element:a
											javascript console
											and go to the network tab when the page is loading.
