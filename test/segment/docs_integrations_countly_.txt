					Countly Integration
			Node:

				Element:p
					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Countly
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Countly in the format they understand.
			Node:

				Element:p
					Our Countly integration code is open sourced on Github. Feel free to check it out:

								Getting Started
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								To get started with Countly and Segment, you‚Äôll want to first integrate your mobile app with our
							Element:a
								iOS
								or
							Element:a
								Android
								sources.
						Node:

								Once the Segment library is integrated with your app, toggle Countly on in your Segment integrations, and add your application‚Äôs
							Element:strong
								App Key
								and
							Element:strong
								Server URL
								which you can find in your Countly Application Management. If you‚Äôre using their cloud hosted solution (not hosting your own Count.ly server), then your
							Element:strong
								Server URL
								is
							Element:code
								https://cloud.count.ly
								.
						Node:
