											Source Collaborators
									Node:

										Element:p
											You can invite source collaborators to any source(s) to which you have access. An invitation gives the user complete access to that source and its settings but not the ability to see other sources in your account or workspace. The user would also not be able to see any workspace, account, or billing details.

											To add new owners to a source, go to your source settings, then collaborators.
