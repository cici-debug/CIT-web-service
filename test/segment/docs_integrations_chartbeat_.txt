								Getting Started
						Node:

							Element:p
								When you toggle on Chartbeat in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading chartbeat.js onto your page. This means you should remove Chartbeat‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Your Chartbeat real-time dashboard will start showing live concurrent visitors.
						Node:
						(type) c

								Chartbeat is only supported on the client-side.
