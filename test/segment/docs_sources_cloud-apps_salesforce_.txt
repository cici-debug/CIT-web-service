							Element:ol
							Element:li
							Element:p
								From your workspace’s
							Element:code
								/sources
								page, click
							Element:code
								add source
								.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Choose Salesforce.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Give the source a nickname and a schema name. The nickname will be used to designate the source in the Segment interface, and the schema name is the namespace you’ll be querying against in your warehouse. Both can be whatever you like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the source itself, like
							Element:code
								Salesforce
								for nickname and
							Element:code
								sfdc
								,
							Element:code
								salesforce
								, or
							Element:code
								sfdc_prod
								for the schema name.

							Element:strong
								Note
								that you can add multiple instances if you have multiple SalesForce accounts. That’s why we allow you to customize the source’s nickname and schema name!

											Sync
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Salesforce has a sync component, which means we’ll make requests to their API on your behalf on a 3 hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, we’ll grab all the Salesforce objects (and their corresponding properties) according to the Collections table below. The objects will be written into a separate schema, corresponding to the source instance’s schema name you designated upon creation. For example, if you went with
										Element:code
											sfdc_prod
											, the
										Element:code
											leads
											collection will be accessible at
										Element:code
											sfdc_prod.leads
											in SQL.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Our sync component uses an upsert API, so the data in your warehouse loaded via sync will reflect the latest state of the corresponding resource in Salesforce. For example, if
										Element:code
											lead_status
											from
										Element:code
											active
											to
										Element:code
											inactive
											between syncs, on its next sync that tickets status will be
										Element:code
											inactive
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source runs pull your data into the Segment Hub, and warehouse runs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources will sync with Segment every 3 hours. Depending on your Warehouses plan, we will push the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											At the moment, we don’t support filtering which objects or properties get synced. If you’re interested in this feature, please let us know!

											Deleting Records
									Node:

										Element:p
											Segment supports the use of soft deletes in Salesforce. If you perform a soft delete on a record in Salesforce, your next one to two warehouses syncs will change the value of
										Element:code
											is_deleted
											for the assoicated record to
										Element:code
											True
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											At this time, we do not support hard deletes in Salesforce. Use of hard deletes will result in the data remaining in the warehouse with

											is_deleted
											set to

											False
