					I need to do some maintenance on my data warehouse. What do I do?

					Head to the Settings tab in your Warehouse menu and disable syncing your warehouse. When you re-enable the warehouse, we’ll automatically sync the events we saw while it was disabled.

											Can we transform or clean up old data to new formats or specs?
									Node:

											This is a common question if the data you’re collecting has evolved over time. For example, if you used to track the event
										Element:code
											Signup
											but now track
										Element:code
											Signed Up
											, you’d probably like to merge those two tables to make querying simple and understandable.

											We don’t currently have a good way to let you define versions or transformations of the data as your data collection spec changes. Some customers have used
										Element:a
											Redshift Views
											to combine different events. In the meantime, we’re looking into ways we can let you do this simply within our interface –
										Element:a
											open to suggestions
											as to how you’d prefer we do it!
