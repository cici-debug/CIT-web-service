					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Relay
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Relay in the format they understand.

								userId
								as Relay‚Äôs External User ID. Segment‚Äôs special traits recognized as Relay‚Äôs standard user profile fields (in parentheses) are:
