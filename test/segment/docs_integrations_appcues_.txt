					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Appcues
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Appcues in the format they understand.
			Node:

								JS and Server-side Integrations
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Appcues provides two Segment integrations.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The first, our JavaScript integration with Segment‚Äôs
							Element:code
								analytics.js
								, is the traditional way to use Appcues as part of the Segment platform. Calls to
							Element:code
								analytics.identify
								are used to indicate user properties, and
							Element:code
								analytics.page
								or
							Element:code
								analytics.track
								will send events to the Appcues API.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Separately, Appcues offers a server-side integration with Segment, which is useful if you‚Äôd like to send user profile or event data to Appcues from another Segment partner service. (Note that this is different from
							Element:a
								Segment Sources
								, which allows you to bring multiple sources of Segment data together in your own data warehouse.)
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The server-side integration may be used simultaneously with the JS integration. In many cases, this is preferable to routing all data through the JS integration.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The user profile and event data received through Appcues‚Äô server-side Segment integration can be used to segment and target Appcues flows, just like data received from the JS integration.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For example, using the server-side integration, customer profile and event data could be directed from a CRM tool into the Appcues platform. This data could then be used for content targeting and user segmentation in the Appcues content editor, alongside data from our
							Element:code
								analytics.js
								integration.

								Identify
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you
							Element:code
								identify
								on
							Element:code
								analytics.js
								, we call
							Element:code
								Appcues.identify
								. This is the preferred method of using and targeting on user properties.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To get the most out of Appcues, you‚Äôll want to send as much user data as possible in the identify call. Properties are used to target experiences to specific users and personalize content. Most Appcues customers send properties that fall into a few groups:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Properties to target based on broad classifications such as
							Element:code
								role
								or
							Element:code
								userType
							Element:li
								Properties to personalize Appcues content such as
							Element:code
								name
								,
							Element:code
								firstName
								or
							Element:code
								company
							Element:li
								Properties to target based on user lifecycle such as
							Element:code
								createdAt
								(date) or usage metrics such as
							Element:code
								numTasksComplete

								Track
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Calls to
							Element:code
								analytics.track
								invoke
							Element:code
								Appcues.track
								as well. This will send event data to the Appcues platform, where it can be used for future content triggering.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:h2
								Page
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Appcues will check to see if a user qualifies for an experience every time the page changes. When you first call
							Element:code
								page
								using
							Element:code
								analytics.js
								,
							Element:code
								Appcues.start
								checks if there are any current flows for the user and loads them if necessary.

											Whitelisted Domains
									Node:

										Element:p
											By default, Appcues will target based on the path of the URL. So if we created an Appcues experience and targeted it to
										Element:code
											/integrations
											, it would appear wherever the embed script is installed with that URL path, like appcues.com/integrations and my.appcues.com/integrations. If your analytics.js script is installed on multiple domains (e.g. your marketing site and your web app), you‚Äôll want to use Appcues whitelisted domains when targeting your experience.

These events will be sent as track calls to the other integrations you‚Äôve turned on. A partial list of Appcues content lifecycle events that can be tracked:
