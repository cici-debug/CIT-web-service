			Node:

					The
				Element:code
					track
					API call is how you record any actions your users perform, along with any properties that describe the action.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Each action is known as an event. Each event has a name, like
				Element:strong
					Registered
					, and properties, for example a
				Element:strong
					Registered
					event might have properties like
				Element:code
					plan
					or
				Element:code
					accountType
					. Calling
				Element:code
					track
					in one of our
				Element:a
					sources
					is one of the first steps to getting started with Segment.
			Node:

				Element:p
					Here’s the payload of a typical
				Element:code
					track
					call with most
				Element:a
					common fields
					removed:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					{ "type": "track", "event": "Registered", "properties": { "plan": "Pro Annual", "accountType" : "Facebook" } }
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					And here’s the corresponding Javascript event that would generate the above payload:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					analytics.track("Registered", { plan: "Pro Annual", accountType: "Facebook" });
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Beyond the common fields, the
				Element:code
					track
					call has the following fields:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:table
				Element:tr
				Element:th
				Element:strong
					Field
				Element:th
				Element:strong
					Type
				Element:th

					Description
				Element:tr
				Element:td

					event
				Element:em
					required
				Element:td
					String
				Element:td
					Name of the action that a user has performed.
				Element:p
					See the
				Element:a
					Event field docs
					for more detail
				Element:tr
				Element:td
				Element:code
					properties
				Element:em
					optional
				Element:td
					Object
				Element:td
					Free-form dictionary of properties of the event, like
				Element:code
					revenue
				Element:p

								Event
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Every
							Element:code
								track
								call records a single user action. We call these “events”. We recommend that you make your event names human-readable, so that everyone on your team (even you, after all that caffeine) can know what they mean instantly.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Do not use nondescript names like
							Element:strong
								Event 12
								or
							Element:strong
								TMDropd
								. Instead, use unique but recognizable names like
							Element:strong
								Video Recorded
								and
							Element:strong
								Order Completed
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								We recommend event names built from a noun and past-tense verb.
								For more information about best practices in event naming, check out our
							Element:a
								Analytics Academy lesson on best practices for naming conventions for clean data
								.
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								We have standardized a series of reserved event names that have special semantic meaning. We map these events to tools that support them whenever possible. See the

								Properties
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Properties are extra pieces of information you can tie to events you track. They can be anything that will be useful while analyzing the events later. We recommend sending properties whenever possible because they give you a more complete picture of what your users are doing.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								We’ve reserved some properties that have semantic meanings, and we handle them in special ways. For example, we always expect
							Element:code
								revenue
								to be a dollar amount that we send to tools that handle revenue tracking.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You should
							Element:strong
								only use reserved properties for their intended meaning
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The following is all the reserved properties we have standardized that apply to all events. Check out the
							Element:a
								Semantic Events docs
								for properties specific to individual reserved events.

						(type) c

								Property
							Element:th
							Element:strong
								Type
							Element:th
							Element:strong
								Description
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								revenue
							Element:td
								Number
							Element:td
								Amount of revenue an event resulted in
							Element:p
								This should be a decimal value, so a shirt worth $19.99 would result in a
							Element:code
								revenue
								of
							Element:code
								19.99
								.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								currency
							Element:td
								String
							Element:td
								Currency of the revenue an event resulted in
							Element:p
								This should be sent in the
							Element:a
								ISO 4127 format
								. If this is not set, we assume the revenue to be in US dollars.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:code
								value
							Element:td
								Number
							Element:td
								An abstract “value” to associate with an event
							Element:p
								This is typically used in situations where the event doesn’t generate real-dollar revenue, but has an intrinsic value to a marketing team, like newsletter signups.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Note:
								You might be used to some integrations recognizing special properties differently. For example, Mixpanel has a special
							Element:code
								track_charges
								method for accepting revenue. Luckily, you don’t have to worry about those inconsistencies. Just pass us
							Element:code
								revenue
								.
							Element:strong
								We’ll handle all of the integration-specific conversions for you automatically.
								Same goes for the rest of the reserved properties.
