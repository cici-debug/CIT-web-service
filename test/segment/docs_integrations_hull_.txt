								Publishing data back to Segment
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you enter your
							Element:strong
								Segment Write Key
								in the Ship‚Äôs settings, then Hull will send customer data to Segment. When a user enters or leaves a Hull segment, a new
							Element:code
								identify
								call with be sent with the following traits :
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								analytics.identify(userId, { "hull_segments": ["all","matching","segment","names"], "custom_1": "value_1", "custom_2": "value_2", },{ "groupId": "user's group Id if he has one" })
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In the Ship settings, you can choose which traits are sent to Segment.com. This lets you send any trait that has been computed or collected from enrichment steps to other tools.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can also filter in the Ship Settings the customer segments will be sent back to Segment.com to those matching one or more of your Hull segments.
