					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					Errorception

				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Errorception in the format they understand.

								When you toggle on Errorception in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Errorception‚Äôs beacon.js onto your page. This means you should remove Errorception‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Your Errorception dashboard will start showing any javascript errors that are occurring on your site.

								Errorception is only supported on the client-side.
