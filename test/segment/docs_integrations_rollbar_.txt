					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Rollbar
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Rollbar in the format they understand.

						Node:

								Enabling Source Maps
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This feature makes use of JavaScript Source Maps to translate the minified code references back into the original source. To use this feature in Rollbar, be sure to do the following:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Enable source maps and fill out the Code Version in your
							Element:a
								Rollbar settings
								in the Segment UI.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Provide your source map. There are two ways you can do this:
							Element:p
								a. Automatic download: place a comment like the following at the bottom of your minified JavaScript files:
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								//# sourceMappingURL=URL_TO_SOURCE_MAP
							Element:p
								b. Upload pre-deploy: at the beginning of your deploy script, upload a source map package via Rollbar‚Äôs API.
							Element:p
								For more detail on providing your source map, checkout
							Element:a
								Rollbar‚Äôs documentation here
