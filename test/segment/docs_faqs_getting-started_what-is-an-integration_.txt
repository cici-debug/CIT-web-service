					What is an integration?

					Integrations are business tools or apps that you can connect via Segment with the flick of a switch. Some of our most popular integrations are Google Analytics, Mixpanel, KISSmetrics, Customer.io, Intercom, and KeenIO.

					All these tools run on the same data: who are your customers and what are they doing. However, each tool requires that data in slightly different formats. Without Segment, you have to write code to track all of this information, again and again, for each tool, on each page of your app or website.

					We eliminate this process by introducing an abstraction layer. You just send your data to us. We understand it, translate it, and send it along to any integration you toggle on in the Segment integrations dashboard. Immediately, your user data will start flowing into those toolsâ€™ dashboards. No extra code required!
