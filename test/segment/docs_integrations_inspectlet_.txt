					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Inspectlet
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Inspectlet in the format they understand.

								When you toggle on Inspectlet in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Inspectlet‚Äôs tracker.js onto your page. This means you should remove Inspectlet‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Your Inspectlet dashboard will start showing recordings.

								Inspectlet is only supported in our client-side javascript library.
