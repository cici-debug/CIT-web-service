					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Google Tag Manager
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Google Tag Manager in the format they understand.

								Getting Started
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								GTM will be loaded on any pages where your Segment snippet is initialized and
							Element:code
								analytics.page
								gets called in client-side javascript. We recommend loading GTM through Segment rather than loading Segment inside of GTM.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once you‚Äôve turned on GTM through Segment you can use GTM to trigger Segment events by entering
							Element:code
								analytics.track
								or
							Element:code
								analytics.page
								calls into GTM. Be sure to ‚Äúpublish‚Äù your GTM container in GTM before trying to load it through Segment, otherwise your container url will 404.

								Page
						Node:

								You must call

								for Google Tag Manager to load. We already include a call to
							Element:code
								page
							Element:code
								analytics.page
								in your default Segment snippet, so if you haven‚Äôt removed that, GTM will work the same as if you installed the GTM snippet directly.

											parameter in your

											page
											calls, and turn on the setting to
										Element:strong
											Track Named Pages
											in your Advanced Options tab under GTM in Segment we will also pass on an event to GTM for that page. See the
										Element:code
											track
											section below for more info on how we send events to GTM.

								Track
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you make a
							Element:a
								call in client-side javascript with Google Tag Manager enabled through Segment we will push the event data to the GTM
							Element:code
								track
							Element:code
								dataLayer
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For example, if you make this
							Element:code
								track
								call:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								analytics.track('Played Video', { title: 'How to Dance the Tango', location: 'Tango FAQ Page' })
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								We will pass it to the
							Element:code
								dataLayer
								as an object like this:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ event: 'Played Video', title: 'How to Dance the Tango', location: 'Tango FAQ Page' }

								UserId and AnonymousId
						Node:

								By default we will also push the
							Element:code
								anonymousId
								and
							Element:code
								userId
								(if exists) into the
							Element:code
								dataLayer
								for each
							Element:code
								page
								or
							Element:code
								track
								call. Since the
							Element:code
								anonymousId
								is created by Segment, we will namespace that property in the
							Element:code
								dataLayer
								as
							Element:code
								segmentAnonymousId
								.
