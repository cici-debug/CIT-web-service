					In the Segment

					Spec
					all the

					API calls
					have a common structure, and a few common fields. However, not every integration accepts every specced field. If you have a question about what fields an integration
				Element:em
					will
					accept, you can refer to the integration’s docs page, or check out our
				Element:a
					open-source integration code on Github

										Element:p
											The

											timestamp specifies when the datapoint occurred. If you’re receiving data from Segment, this is the only timestamp you care about. For
										Element:code
											track

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The

											timestamp specifies the clock time for the client’s device when the network request was made to the Segment API. For libraries and systems that send batched requests, there can be a long gap between a datapoint’s
										Element:code
											timestamp
											and
										Element:code
											sentAt
											. Combined with
										Element:code
											receivedAt
											, we can use
										Element:code
											sentAt
											to correct the original
										Element:code
											timestamp
											in situations where a user’s device clock cannot be trusted (mobile phones and browsers). The
										Element:code
											sentAt
											and
										Element:code
											receivedAt
											timestamps are assumed to occur at the same time (maximum a few hundred milliseconds), and therefore the difference is the user’s device clock skew, which can be applied back to correct the
										Element:code
											timestamp
											.
									Node:

										Element:p
										Element:strong
											Note:
											The

											The

										Element:code
