											Millennial Media recognizes pixel ids, not custom events. When you
										Element:code
											analytics.track(event, properties)
											an event that represents a Millennial Media ad conversion, you‚Äôll need to map the event name on the left to it‚Äôs corresponding Millennial Media pixel id on the right in the integration panel.
