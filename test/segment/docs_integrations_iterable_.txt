					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Iterable
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Iterable in the format they understand.

								Getting Started
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you switch on the Iterable integration in your Segment dashboard, your data will start flowing into Iterable, which will trigger workflows and be available for analytics. You can locate your Iterable API key by going to Integrations ‚Üí API Keys inside the Iterable app.

								Identify
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you call
							Element:code
								identify
								with one of Segment‚Äôs sources, we‚Äôll call Iterable‚Äôs
							Element:a
								update user endpoint
								, to add data for that particular user. All users are keyed by
							Element:code
								email
								or
							Element:code
								userId
								in Iterable. If you do not include a
							Element:code
								userId
								or an
							Element:code
								email
								, the call will throw an error!
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can also call
							Element:code
								identify
								to update user fields. If you need to update the user‚Äôs email address in Iterable, you will need to call our
							Element:a
								/users/updateEmail API directly
								.

								Track
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you call

								track
								with one of Segment‚Äôs sources, we‚Äôll call Iterable‚Äôs
							Element:a
								track API endpoint
								, and send over the event properties as the data fields in the request. The name of the
							Element:code
								track
								event will show up as a Custom Event in Iterable, and will be available to trigger workflows, segment users, and view analytics.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If a user does not already exist in Iterable, calling
							Element:code
								track
								for a user event will add that user into the system. You can track with either an
							Element:code
								email
								or userId (if a
							Element:code
								userId
								exists for that email).

											Note: there is one important difference from the Segment documentation. If you are using the
										Element:code
											Product Added
											/
										Element:code
											Product Removed
											events, you will need to also pass along the ‚Äúproducts‚Äù field with your cart info, just like Segment‚Äôs example for the
										Element:code
											Order Completed
											event.

						Node:

								Calling

						Node:

								If a user does not already exist in Iterable, calling

								the first time you call page for a user, since Iterable keys users by

								. After the first time, you can call page with
