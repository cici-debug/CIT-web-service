					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					Wootric
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Wootric in the format they understand.

								Once the Segment library is integrated with your server, toggle Wootric ‚Äúon‚Äù and add your Account Token in your Segment integrations. You can find your Account Token in your Wootric dashboard, located under the settings menu (the gear on the right) as part of the JS beacon installation instructions. Your unique account token will be located inside the snippet, labeled
							Element:code
								account_token
								. Take the full string to the right excluding the single quote. It should look something like this: ‚ÄòNPS_1234abcd‚Äô
