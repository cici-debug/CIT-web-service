								Once your Segment source starts receiving data, you can send them to Freshsales by enabling this integration. You can enable it from Freshsales Admin Settings for Third Party Integrations. Select the Segment source from which data has to be forwarded to Freshsales.
						Node:

								You can use

								a user, we’ll pass that user’s information to Freshsales.

											User ID

											Default Traits
									Node:

											Segment has reserved some traits that have semantic meanings for users. You should only use reserved traits for their intended meaning. Check the

											to get a list of reserved traits.

											All attributes that are a part of traits should correspond to the internal names of those fields in Freshsales. Attributes that are not mapped with their corresponding fields are ignored.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											However, we make exception to two attributes ‘title’ and ‘phone’ that are part of default traits. They are automatically mapped to Freshsales attributes ‘job_title’ and ‘work_number’ respectively.

											As part of traits, you can send custom fields created in Freshsales by using their internal names in camel case. You can find internal names in corresponding field settings page. Also, custom fields will not be automatically created. You have to create them in Freshsales before proceeding to send data from Segment.
