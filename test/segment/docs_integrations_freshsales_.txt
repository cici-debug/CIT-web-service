											All attributes that are a part of traits should correspond to the internal names of those fields in Freshsales. Attributes that are not mapped with their corresponding fields are ignored.
									Node:

											However, we make exception to two attributes ‚Äòtitle‚Äô and ‚Äòphone‚Äô that are part of default traits. They are automatically mapped to Freshsales attributes ‚Äòjob_title‚Äô and ‚Äòwork_number‚Äô respectively.

											As part of traits, you can send custom fields created in Freshsales by using their internal names in camel case. You can find internal names in corresponding field settings page. Also, custom fields will not be automatically created. You have to create them in Freshsales before proceeding to send data from Segment.
