							Element:ol
							Element:li
							Element:p
								From your workspace’s
							Element:code
								sources
								page, click
							Element:code
								add source
								.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Choose Mandrill.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Give the source a nickname and a schema name. The nickname will be used to designate the source in the Segment interface, and the schema name is the namespace you’ll be querying against in your warehouse. Both can be whatever you like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the source itself, like
							Element:code
								Mandrill
								for nickname and
							Element:code
								mandrill
								or
							Element:code
								mandrill_prod
								for the schema name.
							Element:p
							Element:img
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Note
								that you can add multiple instances if you have multiple Mandrill accounts. That’s why we allow you to customize the source’s nickname and schema name!
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Copy the auto-generated Webhook URL and paste it into Mandrill’s Event Notification settings pane under Settings > Webhook.
							Element:p
							Element:img
							Element:p

								Once you enable the webhook, you’re good to go! We’ll automatically create your collections based on which triggers you select. If any seem unnecessary for your analysis, feel free to leave them unchecked.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Finally, back in the Segment UI, press Next and then Finish to wrap up the setup flow.

										Element:p
											The Mandrill source is comprised only of a streaming component which listens in real time for inbound webhooks from
										Element:a
											Mandrill’s Webhooks
											and batches the events to be uploaded on your next warehouse flush. These events are only ever appended to your warehouse. Since Mandrill is strictly used for transactional emails triggered directly by API calls, there are no “dimensional” concepts in their data model that would require any additional components.
