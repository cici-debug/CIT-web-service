								The Sailthru server-side integration will allow you to add users, send custom events and purchase events. Once the Segment library is integrated, toggle Sailthru on in your Segment integration panel and add your API Key and Shared Secret, which you can find in the Sailthru Dashboard under
							Element:strong
								App Settings > Setup > API & Postbacks
								.

								Important

								lookup in the Sailthru UI. These are currently in Beta so you may need to contact your account representative to enable these features.
						Node:

								Sailthru supports
							Element:code
								identify
								and
							Element:code

								events. For e-commerce events, this integration supports

											Identify
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When you
										Element:code
											identify
											a user, we will pass that user’s information to Sailthru with
										Element:code
											userId
											as Sailthru’s External User ID (
										Element:code
											extid
											). Segment sends all traits as
										Element:code
											vars
											to Sailthru.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											An
										Element:code
											identify
											event will appear in Sailthru’s user lookup feature if there is an email present (Sailthru only allows a user lookup up based on an email):
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Or within the
										Element:strong
											Users > Lists
											feature, based on the default list you configured in the Segment UI or passed in through the integrations object like so:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											analytics.identify("38472034892",{ "name": "Hamurai", "email": "Hamurai@gmail.com", "quote": "Rick, you love those BBQs, Rick" },{ Sailthru:{ defaultListName: "testingList" } });
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You can also configure an
										Element:code
											optout_email
											value in the Segment UI, or pass in a value through the integrations object with one of the Sailthru expected values:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											analytics.identify("3242351231",{ "name": "Duck With Muscles", "email": "MusclesQuack@gmail.com", "quote": "Oh, wow...Baby Wizard was a Parasite?!" },{ Sailthru:{ optoutValue: "basic" } });
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											So if you send an
										Element:code
											identify
											call without a
										Element:code
											traits.email
											and only a
										Element:code
											userId
											, the profile will be created in Sailthru but you would not be able to find that user via their
										Element:strong
											User Look Up
											feature.

						(layer)2
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:h3
											Track
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When you
										Element:code
											track
											an event, we will send that event to Sailthru as a custom event.
										Element:strong
											Important
											: You must have each event mapped in Sailthru within
										Element:strong
											Communications > Lifecycle Optimizer
											in order to leverage the custom event. Be sure that the
										Element:strong
											Status
											is set to
										Element:strong
											Active
											:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Your account must have triggers or lifecycle optimizer enabled. This should be enabled when the account is setup, however, just to be sure you may need to reach out to your account representative to confirm it is enabled.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											A custom event will hit the
										Element:strong
											Sailthru Lifecycle Optimizer
											feature. Navigate to
										Element:strong
											Communications > Lifecycle Optimizer
											in your Sailthru dashboard:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c

											Configure a custom event to a new flow and trigger a follow up action to the event:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3

									Node:

											For instance, in the above example notice that the
										Element:code

											event will add the user who trigger the event to a list.

									Node:

											Purchases
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When you
										Element:code
											track
											an event with the name
										Element:code
											Order Completed
											using the
										Element:a
											e-commerce tracking API
											, we will send the products you’ve listed to Sailthru’s purchase log:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In addition, it will also appear within the user view under purchase history:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Note that the main identifier is
										Element:code
											email
											not
										Element:code
											id
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Sailthru does not allow the extid to be the main lookup identifier for their Purchase API. Instead, Sailthru requires an
										Element:code
											email
											as the primary identifier. Segment will make a GET request to retrieve the user’s email based on their
										Element:code
											userId
											, which is their
										Element:code
											extid
											in Sailthru.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If the user and their email does not exist in Sailthru, the event will throw an error. If the user exists, the purchase will be added to their profile. Be sure to call
										Element:code
											identify
											with an
										Element:code
											email
											passed in the
										Element:code
											traits
											object prior to the
										Element:code
											Order Completed
											event. If you are sending events using one of Segment’s server-side libraries and want to be sure, you can also send the email value in your
										Element:code
											track
											calls under
										Element:code
											context.traits.email
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Once
										Element:code
											Order Completed
											is triggered, Segment will pass in
										Element:code
											incomplete: 0
											to signify that the order is now complete. Segment will map the following Sailthru
										Element:a
											required fields
											from the
										Element:a
											v2 Order Completed Spec
											:

											Note
											: the

											for you, so be sure this value is present on each
