											AdLearn Open Platform recognizes pixel ids, not custom event names. When you
										Element:code
											analytics.track(event, properties)
											an event that represents an AdLearn Open Platform conversion, you‚Äôll need to map the event name on the left to it‚Äôs corresponding AdLearn Open Platform pixel id on the right. These pixel ids show up as the
										Element:code
											type
											parameters in the pixel.
