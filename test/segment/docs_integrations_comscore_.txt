					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					comScore
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to comScore in the format they understand.

								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading comScores‚Äôs beacon.js onto your page.

								This means you should remove comScore‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								comScore will automatically start recording data.

						Node:

							Element:p
								To get started with comScore and Segment, you‚Äôll want to first integrate your mobile app with our
							Element:a
								iOS
								or
							Element:a
								Android
								sources. comScore can only accept data sent directly from their iOS and Android SDKs. For that reason we can only send data directly from our iOS and Android SDKs to comScore.
							Element:strong
								Data recorded in our server-side sources cannot be sent to comScore.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once the Segment source is integrated with your app, toggle comScore on in your Segment integrations, and add your
							Element:strong
								Customer C2
								client ID,
							Element:strong
								Publisher Secret
								string, which you can find in your comScore Direct settings. These new settings will take up to an hour to propagate to all of your existing users. For new users it‚Äôll be instantaneous!

										Element:p
											We enable you to choose if you want the comScore SDK to update the application usage times on regular intervals. This is turned off by default but if you enable
										Element:strong
											Auto Update
											we‚Äôll enable this feature. By default, we have
										Element:code
											Foreground Only
											on, this means we‚Äôll only update usage times when your app is in the foreground, if you uncheck this then we‚Äôll update usage times even when your app is backgrounded. This is recommended if your app can deliver a user experience while the app is backgrounded, Push Notifications being a common example. We also allow you to configure the
										Element:strong
											Auto Update Interval
											which controls how often the SDK updates usage information. This defaults to 60 seconds.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3

											It‚Äôs recommended that if you enable this, then you also implement the following comScore methods.
									Node:

										Element:p
										Element:code
											onUXActive
											for when the app becomes active after a period of inactivity.
