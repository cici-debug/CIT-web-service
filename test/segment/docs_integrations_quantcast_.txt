					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Quantcast
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Quantcast in the format they understand.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					We have both web and mobile integrations with Quantcast. The two integrations are outlined below. Our Quantcast integration code is also open source on Github. Feel free to check it out:

								When you toggle on Quantcast for a website in Segment, this is what happens:

							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading quant.js onto your page. This means you should remove Quantcast’s snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Quantcast will automatically start recording data. If this is the first time sending data to Quantcast it can take them up to
							Element:strong
								12 days
								to process your new data.

						Node:

								Note: For Quantcast to load you must call our page method. There is a call to page in your javascript snippet by default, so as long as you don’t remove it Quantcast will load whenever your snippet loads!

														Labels
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														When you call
													Element:code
														page
														,
													Element:code
														track
														or
													Element:code
														screen
														, we’ll pass the page name, event name or screen name and the category (if provided) to Quantcast as a label. The standard label will look like this “
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:title
														“ for page or screen, and ““ for track events. If you enable Quantcast for advertisers then we’ll send “_fp.event.“ to match Quantcast’s internal data structures for advertisers. If you do not pass any
													Element:code
														category
														or
													Element:code
														name
														for a
													Element:code
														.page()
														call, we will fallback on Quantcast’s default label.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Here’s an example for Quantcast Advertisers:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														analytics.page('Blog'); // sends label _fp.event.Blog analytics.page(); /// sends default label _fp.event.Default
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														For non-advertisers:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														analytics.page('Blog'); // sends label "Blog" analytics.page(); // does not send any label
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														If you opt to send multiple custom labels, you can do so in a few ways. You can attach a property called
													Element:code
														label
														and define a custom label there or send them via the
													Element:code
														Quantcast.labels
														in the
													Element:code
														options
														object.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														For advertisers:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														analytics.page('Home', { label: 'customLabel' }); // This will send label as _fp.event.Home,customLabel analytics.page('Home', {}, { Quantcast: { labels: ['customLabel1', 'customLabel2'] } }); // This will send label as _fp.event.Home,customLabel1,customLabel2
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
													Element:strong

											Script unverified or undetected by third-party tool
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Many times this is a limitation on the tool’s detection process, where the detector is looking for a specific HTML element on your page. Our client side analytics.js library asynchronously loads the tool’s library or pixel onto the page. As such, the detection fails.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In order to confirm that the tool’s library or pixel is actually loaded onto the page, you can open up the
										Element:a
											javascript console
											and go to the network tab when the page is loading.
