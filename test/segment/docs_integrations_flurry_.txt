					Flurry Integration
			Node:

					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Flurry
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Flurry in the format they understand.
			Node:

					Our Flurry integration code is open sourced on Github. Feel free to check it out:

								Getting Started
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To get started with Flurry and Segment, you‚Äôll want to first integrate your mobile app with our
							Element:a
								iOS
								or
							Element:a
								Android
								sources. Flurry can only accept data sent directly from their iOS and Android SDKs. For that reason we can only send data directly from our iOS and Android SDKs to Flurry. Data recorded in our server-side sources, Xamarin, or Analytics.js cannot be sent to Flurry.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once the Segment library is integrated with your app, toggle Flurry on in your Segment integrations, and add your application‚Äôs
							Element:strong
								API Key
								which you can find in your Flurry app settings. These new settings will take up to an hour to propagate to all of your existing users. For new users it‚Äôll be instantaneous!
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The next thing you‚Äôll want to do is identify the user, so that Flurry can give you more user-centric data.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:em
								Note: Flurry does not display data in real time. We‚Äôve seen that it can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days for certain types of data to sync with Flurry.

								Identify
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The first thing you‚Äôll want to do is to
							Element:a
								a user with any relevant information as soon as they log-in, or sign-up. You record this with our
							Element:code
								identify
							Element:a
								method.
							Element:code

							Element:code
								userId
								of a user and any
							Element:code
								traits
								you know about them.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you call
							Element:a
								, we‚Äôll set the user ID in Flurry, and set any special Flurry
							Element:code
								identify
							Element:code
								traits
								you provide, such as
							Element:code
								gender
								, or
							Element:code
								age
								.

								your user‚Äôs behavior so that you can figure out how to increase engagement, virality, or whatever key action is critical to your business. You can use the
							Element:code
								track
							Element:a
								method to do this.

						Node:
