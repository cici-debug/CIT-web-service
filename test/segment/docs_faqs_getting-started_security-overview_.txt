											My write key is visible, should I be worried?
									Node:

										Element:p
											In order for any source to send data to the right destination, there needs to be a unique identifier. All services operate similarly—Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Hubspot, Marketo, etc. Sometimes it’s called an API key, application token, and so on. In our case, it is the write key.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											For the Segment script to work in the browser, the write key must be exposed.

											What if someone uses my write key maliciously?
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you suspect that your write key is being used maliciously, please submit a ticket so we can change the keys for you as soon as possible.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This hasn’t been a big problem for customers in the past. We’ve only had to change the write keys for a few customers, and it is usually due to a bot scraping an HTML page where the Segment snippet is present, and re-posting that page on another domain.

									Node:
