					Seg Integration
			Node:

				Element:p
					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Seg
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Seg in the format they understand.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					This integration is maintained by Seg.

											Identify
									Node:

										Element:p
											When you call identify on analytics.js, we pass all traits into Seg. You must provide a
										Element:code
											traits.email
											for Seg to
										Element:code
											identify
											your customers, otherwise they are effectively anonymous until a
										Element:code
											traits.email
											is specified.

											Track
									Node:

										Element:p
											When you call track, Seg looks for standard
										Element:a
											Segment e-commerce event names
											and they get mapped to standard Seg ecommerce event names as follows:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
										Element:code
											Viewed Product Category
											is mapped to
										Element:a
										Element:code
											RangeView
										Element:li
										Element:code
											Viewed Product
											is mapped to
										Element:a
										Element:code
											ProductView
										Element:li
										Element:code
											Added Product
											is mapped to
										Element:a
										Element:code
											AddedToBasket
										Element:li
										Element:code
											Order Completed
											is mapped to
										Element:a
										Element:code
											OrderPlaced
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											All other event names are ignored by Seg as there is no logical map.

														Augmenting the Segment Ecommerce Spec for Seg
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Seg requires some extra information on the above events for full functionality (although Seg will remain nearly fully functional if not further changes are made).
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The changes that are recommended are as follows:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:ul
													Element:li
														Include “Brands” and/or “Categories” arrays to
													Element:em
														all events
														, for example
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														analytics.track('Viewed Product Category', { category: 'Games', categories: ['Games', 'Board Games'], // This would be all categories (and parent categories) that the product exists in brands: ['Hasbro'] });
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:ul
													Element:li
														Include extra properties to
													Element:code
														Order Completed
														, for example
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														analytics.track('Completed Order', { orderId: '50314b8e9bcf000000000000', total: 30, revenue: 25, shipping: 3, tax: 2, discount: 2.5, coupon: 'hasbros', currency: 'USD', repeat: true, delivery_method: 'Standard shipping', _p: 15, // This is the (estimated) profit for the order products: [ { id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439011', sku: '45790-32', name: 'Monopoly: 3rd Edition', price: 19, quantity: 1, category: 'Games', categories: ['Games', 'Board Games'], brands: ['Hasbro'], image_url: 'http://example.com/url-to-product-image';, original_price: 19.99, variant_name: 'Product Variant Name' } ] });
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:ul
													Element:li
														Include an extra 5 properties to
													Element:code
														Viewed Product
														,
													Element:code
														Added Product
														and
													Element:code
														Order Completed
														, for example
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														analytics.track('Viewed Product', { id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439011', sku: '45790-32', name: 'Monopoly: 3rd Edition', price: 18.99, category: 'Games', categories: ['Games', 'Board Games'], brands: ['Hasbro'], image_url: 'http://example.com/url-to-product-image';, original_price: 19.99, variant_name: 'Product Variant Name' });

											Alias
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Our alias method can be used from your server to “re-identify” an existing user identity to a new one. Most of the time this happens when you identify a visitor changes their email address after they opt in.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To connect the two identities you’ll need to alias their current identity to their new one.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Here’s an example of using alias to update the identity from an old email address to a new email address:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											analytics.alias('old-email@segment.com','new-email@segment.com')
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If both parameters are not email address types, the call is ignored in Seg.
