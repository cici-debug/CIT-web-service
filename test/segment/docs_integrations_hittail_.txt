					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					HitTail
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to HitTail in the format they understand.

								Getting Started
						Node:

							Element:p
								When you toggle on HitTail in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading hittail.js onto your page. This means you should remove HitTail‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								HitTail will automatically start recording search keywords and showing them on its dashboard.
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								HitTail does not track any other forms of data, so none of the rest of our API is supported.
