					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Pardot
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Pardot in the format they understand.

								When you toggle on Pardot in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Pardot’s javascript onto your page. This means you should remove Pardot’s snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Pardot will start automatically collecting anonymous visitor data data on your site.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Pardot is supported on the client-side and server-side.

											API Access
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You’ll need to provide API access to Segment via Pardot user credentials. Since Pardot’s API
										Element:a
											requires
											that we provide an email and password to get access to their API, we’ll need to store this password in plain text in our database.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Since we don’t want to ask for the password of one of your actual user accounts, we recommend you create a new Pardot user account for Segment. Please create this user by going to
										Element:em
											Admin > Users and Groups > Add User
											, and creating an Administrator role user.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Also make sure to disable IP Security in this Pardot user account. First navigate to the
										Element:a
											user settings
											, then click “Edit Account”, and change “Enable IP Security” to “Disabled”. Why is this necessary? Segment server IP address(es) may change, meaning we cannot whitelist particular addresses.

											If you have web pages with different campaigns, you should follow

									Node:
									(type) c

											Our script will use the most appropriate campaign Id.

						Node:

								When you call

								trait so that we can check if that prospect already exists. If it does, we’ll just update its fields with the

									Node:

											When you call

											with an

											email
											, and then we’ll associate the current visitor’s web page activities with that prospect.
