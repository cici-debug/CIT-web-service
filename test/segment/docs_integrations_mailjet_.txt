								Getting Started
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Navigate to the ‚ÄúApp Connections‚Äù page
							Element:em
								(Account -> App Connections) and click on the ‚ÄúSegment‚Äù integration block to find your Segment Authentication key.
								If you do not see the App Connections page for any reason, please contact us at plugins@mailjet.com. Select a Contact list from the drop down menu that you wish to have Segment send contact property data to.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Be sure and note the contact list id inside the field below the chosen list because you will need to paste it into your Segment account so Segment knows where to send the data to.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once you have this, navigate over to Segment. Within your existing or new workspace, find Mailjet in the Integrations tab. Click open the tile and paste your Authentication key within the Settings slide out.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Confirm that the contact list id is the same, click save, and then Enable Integration.
