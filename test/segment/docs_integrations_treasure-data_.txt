					Treasure Data Integration
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Treasure Data
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Treasure Data in the format they understand.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					This integration is maintained by Treasure Data.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Once the Segment library is integrated with your server, toggle Treasure Data on in your Segment integrations, and add your API key (which you can find in your Treasure Data console). You will also need to specify the destination database name.
			Node:

				Element:p
					The Segment Treasure Data integration is 100% handled through our servers, so you don‚Äôt need to bundle their iOS or Android SDKs.

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											A table with all of your alias method calls. This table will include all of the traits you identify users by as top-level columns, for example
										Element:code
