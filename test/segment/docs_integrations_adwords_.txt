								Getting Started
						Node:

							Element:p
								With Segment your events can be used to fire an AdWords conversion pixel from your website
							Element:strong
								in client-side javascript.
								It can also be used to trigger AdWords conversion from your mobile app via
							Element:strong
								Server to Server
								integration so you don‚Äôt have to include the SDK in your app. Make sure when you‚Äôre setting up your Adwords conversions that you choose the appropriate tracking method.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								From your Segment Integrations page click on AdWords. You‚Äôll need to enter your Conversion Id from your AdWords account first. Next, enter the name of the event exactly as it appears in your
							Element:a
								call on the left and map it to your Adwords conversion‚Äôs google_conversion_label on the right.

											To find a conversion ID look inside of your AdWords account and navigate to Tools -> Conversions, then click the red +Conversion button. You‚Äôll be prompted to choose what types of conversions you‚Äôd like to track. For the purposes of integrating with Segment, you‚Äôll choose either ‚ÄúWebsite‚Äù or ‚ÄúApp‚Äù.

										Element:code

											or

											calls. We will only send remarketing tags for events you have mapped with conversion labels. You can use these properties in your Adwords account to create audiences to remarket to!
									Node:

											If you‚Äôd like to

											send Remarketing Tags, you can whitelist the names of your Segment

											events under the

											Send Standalone Remarketing Tags
											setting and we will send a remarketing tag for this event with its properties without sending a conversion tag.

In order to achieve this, there needs to be the following properties that our SDKs should include but you‚Äôll want to make double check these properties in your segment debugger if your conversions aren‚Äôt being logged.

											Inconsistent Conversions
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The most common reason for AdWords conversion pixels to fire inconsistently is that the page redirects or reloads before the pixel has time to be loaded on the page. Make sure your page does not redirect or reload for at least 300ms after the conversion event happens.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											We recommend using our
										Element:code
											trackLink
											or
										Element:code
											trackForm
											helpers to delay the page redirect.
