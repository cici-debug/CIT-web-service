								From your workspace’s

								page, click

								add source
								.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Choose Intercom.
							Element:li
							Element:p
								Give the source a nickname and a schema name. The nickname will be used to designate the source in the Segment interface, and the schema name is the namespace you’ll be querying against in your warehouse. Both can be whatever you like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the source itself, like
							Element:code
								Intercom
								for nickname and
							Element:code
								intercom
								, or
							Element:code
								intercom_prod
								for the schema name.
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Note
								that you can add multiple instances if you have multiple Intercom accounts. That’s why we allow you to customize the source’s nickname and schema name!

								Next, provide your
							Element:strong
								API Key
								and
							Element:strong
								App ID
								to access your Intercom data. Your App ID and API Keys are available on the API Keys page on Intercom, accessible from your Integration settings. To create a Key, you can click the ‘New API Key’ button on that page. Feel free to use a read only key for the source integration. Your API key will then appear at the bottom of the page.

											Sync
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Our Intercom integration has a sync component, which means we’ll make requests to
										Element:a
											their API
											on your behalf on a 3 hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, we’ll grab all the Intercom objects (and their corresponding properties) according to the collections table below. The objects will be written into a designated schema corresponding to the source instance’s schema name you designated upon creation. For example, if you went with
										Element:code
											intercom_prod
											, the
										Element:code
											users
											collection will be accessible at
										Element:code
											intercom_prod.users
											in SQL.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Our sync component uses an upsert API, so the data in your warehouse loaded via sync will reflect the latest state of the corresponding resource in Intercom. For example, if the
										Element:code
											users.last_seen_ip
											will be the latest value upon each sync.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source runs pull your data into the Segment Hub, and warehouse runs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources will sync with Segment every 3 hours. Depending on your Warehouses plan, we will push the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.
									Node:

											At the moment, we don’t support filtering which objects or properties get synced. If you’re interested in this feature, please let us know!
