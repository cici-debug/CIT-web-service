					Salesforce Marketing Cloud
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Salesforce Marketing Cloud in the format they understand.

											A Note About ExactTarget
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											ExactTarget was recently acquired by Salesforce and renamed “Salesforce Marketing Cloud.” Throughout Segment, we’ll stick to the name Salesforce Marketing Cloud, but know that the names “Salesforce Marketing Cloud” and “ExactTarget” refer to the same product.

											API Access
									Node:

											First, you’ll need to provide Segment access to your Salesforce Marketing Cloud account. We’ll do that by creating a Salesforce Marketing Cloud application.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ol
										Element:li
											If you don’t already have one, create a Salesforce Marketing Cloud
										Element:a
											App Center
											account. (This account is separate from your regular Marketing Cloud login.)
										Element:li
											If you already have apps set up, click
										Element:strong
											Create New App
											.
										Element:li
											Click
										Element:strong
											API Integration
											.
										Element:li
											Give your integration a name. A good default is
										Element:code
											Segment
											for the name, and
										Element:code
											segment
											for the Package name.
										Element:li
											Select “Production ExactTarget Account” and click
										Element:strong
											Link to Account
											to link your App Center account to your Marketing Cloud account. (Alternatively, if you don’t yet have a Marketing Cloud account, you can create a new one now.) Click
										Element:strong
											Next
											.
										Element:li
											Next, change the application’s permissions to match
										Element:a
											these settings
											and click
										Element:strong
											Next
											.
										Element:li
											Review your settings (they should look something like
										Element:a
											this
											). Click
										Element:strong
											Finish
											.

											Set Up Contact Data Storage
									Node:

										Element:p
											Segment will pass any traits you specify in an
										Element:code
											identify
											call through to the
										Element:em
											Identify Data Extension
											you specify in the Segment UI. You’ll need to create this Data Extension manually in SMC’s Contact Builder UI. When creating a Data Extension in SMC, you can set up as many or as few traits as you would like, but a good starting point for your schema is to include Segment’s
										Element:a
											standard identify traits
											.

								Data Formatting
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								SMC is very strict about the format of your data, and will reject most calls that don’t fit an expected format. We format your data in a very consistent way to make setting up your integration as easy as possible.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To keep your data format consistent, predictable, and readable within SMC’s interface, we convert all your property keys to
							Element:code
								Title Case
								before sending them to SMC. For example, the following example data:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "name": "firstLast", "email": "first@example.com", "createdAt": "1970-01-01T00:00:01.989Z" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								or
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "name": "first_last", "email": "first@example.com", "createdAt": "1970-01-01T00:00:01.989Z" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Will both be converted into:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "Name": "First Last", "Email": "first@example.com", "Created At": "1970-01-01T00:00:01.989Z" }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								There are a few more things you should to know about sending data to SMC:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Your Identify Data Extension must have a Primary Key called
							Element:code
								Contact Key
								(we’ll use the
							Element:code
								userId
								from your Segment events to populate this field) so we can link users to SMC’s built-in Contact Key property. (Your
							Element:code
								track
								events can use whichever Primary Key you specify.)
							Element:li
								SMC doesn’t have a good way of handling nested objects, so we exclude them from data we send over.
							Element:li
								SMC accepts ISO-8601-formatted dates, and will reject any calls that include dates which don’t match that format. Be sure to send your dates in ISO format.
							Element:li
								SMC ignores casing differences (e.g.
							Element:code
								created at
								and
							Element:code
								Created At
								are interpreted the same way), so don’t worry about that.
							Element:li
								SMC ignores keys that don’t exist in the target data extension, so if you send a trait
							Element:code
								"nonexistent": "xyz"
								with your data but there’s no matching
							Element:code
								nonexistent
								column on SMC’s end, that trait will simply be ignored.

								Identify
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you call
							Element:code
								identify
								, we’ll create a Salesforce Marketing Cloud Contact and upsert the user’s
							Element:code
								traits
								into the Data Extension you specified in the Segment UI.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								You must include an
							Element:em
								Note:
							Element:code
								email
								trait and a
							Element:code
								userId
								trait with all calls; we won’t forward any
							Element:code
								identify
								calls that are missing both.

								Track
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When you call
							Element:code
								track
								, we’ll fire an event using Salesforce Marketing Cloud’s [eventing API][
							Element:a
								https://code.exacttarget.com/apis-sdks/rest-api/v1/hub/data-events/putDataExtensionRowByKeyAsync.html
								]. This flexible API allows you to upsert information related to a contact into any Data Extension you choose.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								First, you’ll need to set up event mappings in the Segment UI, which tells us which Segment events we should forward to Salesforce Marketing Cloud, and to which Data Extension we should send any given event. When you fire a mapped event through Segment, we’ll send the data through to the Data Extension you specified. These data extensions upsert data so whatever you specify as the primary key, new data will be upserted off of the value of that key. For instance, if you use “Contact Key”, we’ll pass through your calls
							Element:code
								userId
								as the value and that data extension will only have 1 row per
							Element:code
								userId
								, updated with the latest values for each attribute.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								We also let you choose other properties so that you can have 1 row per product, or 1 row per transaction based on a property on your call. If you are creating a data extension table for an
							Element:code
								Order Completed
								event, you could use “Order Id” to grab the value from the
							Element:code
								orderId
								property.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Similar to our conversions above, we will titlecase all properties so
							Element:code
								order_id
								and
							Element:code
								orderId
								both become “Order Id”.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Finally, we have a checkbox,
							Element:code
								UUID Primary Key
								that will override whatever you have in the Primary Key Field and we will pass through a Primary Key with a key of ‘Uuid’ and the value being a UUID.
