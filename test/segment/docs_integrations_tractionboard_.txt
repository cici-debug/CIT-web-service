					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					Tractionboard
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Tractionboard in the format they understand.

								When you track an event, we will send that event to Tractionboard as a custom event. There are certain events that trigger special actions in Tractionboard:
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:code
								Payment Made
								: This is an standard event in Segment (
							Element:a
								Payment Made
								), and it’s translated to the Tractionboard payment event, that is used to get the earnings of certain user.
							Element:li
							Element:code
								Refund Received
								: This is an standard event in Segment (
							Element:a
								Refund Received
								), and it’s translated to the Tractionboard refund event, that is used to subtract this amount to the revenue.
							Element:li
							Element:code
								cancel
								: This event with the userId will update the user status to canceled, and it will count in the churn rate metric.
							Element:li
							Element:code
								signup
								: We expect the signup event with the userId. Signup events are used to compose the UAC metric.
