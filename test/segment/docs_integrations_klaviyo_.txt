					Segment makes it easy to send your data to

					Klaviyo
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Klaviyo in the format they understand.

								When you toggle on Klaviyo in Segment, this is what happens:

						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Klaviyo’s track.js onto your page. This means you should remove Klaviyo’s snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Since Klaviyo only records custom events and custom user data, no events or users will appear in Klaviyo until you start using the API outlined below.
						Node:
						(type) c

											When you call

											with the

											traits
											object. We augment the

											traits

											traits.$id

											since Klaviyo takes the user ID on the

											When sending data to Klaviyo via

											If your

											is an email, or you provide an email in

											, we’ll send it as the

											property to Klaviyo. Also, you can send us

											and we’ll transform it to
										Element:code
											traits.$phone_number
											per Klaviyo’s fancy (we’ll do the same for all of Klaviyo’s

												Node:

													Element:p
														When you call
													Element:code
														identify
														using a

														server side
														library, you can optionally send list data in order to add that person to a specific List in Klaviyo. We will use their
													Element:a
														List API
														.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														In order for this to work, you must add the
													Element:strong
														Private Key
														inside the Klaviyo settings in Segment. You can generate a private key by clicking
													Element:code
														Account > Settings > API Keys > Create API Key
														inside Klaviyo.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														You can choose to provide a default

														listId
														that we can fallback on when adding users to a list. If you’d like to override this default listId, you can also do so by sending it manually via code in
													Element:code
														integrations.Klaviyo.listId
														. You can also choose whether you want to force users to confirm the optin to your list. The default settings will be
													Element:code
														true
														. However, you can uncheck this option in the Klaviyo settings inside Segment or override it per

											Klaviyo supports the
										Element:code
											Order Completed
											event that is outlined in our
										Element:a
											specs
											. If you send us a
										Element:code
											Order Completed
											event, we will send Klaviyo a
										Element:code
											Placed Order
											event and a
										Element:code
											Ordered Product
											event for each item listed in the
										Element:code
											properties.products
											array. We will also attach
										Element:code
											customer_properties
											with the
										Element:code
											userId
											set as
										Element:code
											$id
											for each of those Klaviyo events.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											While it is not included in our spec for a
										Element:code
											Order Completed
											event, you can optionally include a
										Element:code
											productUrl
											and or
										Element:code
											imageUrl
											as a property of an item inside the
										Element:code
											products
											array. We will pass those along to Klaviyo as
										Element:code
											Product URL
											and
										Element:code
											Image URL
											respectively.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Each auto-generated
										Element:code
											Ordered Product
											event requires a unique
										Element:code
											$event_id
											, which Segment automatically generates based on a combination of the
										Element:code
											orderId
											of the parent
										Element:code
											Completed Order
											event, and the
										Element:code
											productId
											,
										Element:code
											id
											or
										Element:code
											sku
											of the product itself (in this order). In other words, you must pass either a
										Element:code
											productId
											,
										Element:code
											id
											or
										Element:code
											sku
											to Segment, or Klaviyo will reject your
										Element:code
											Ordered Product
											events.

											An example
										Element:code
											Order Completed
