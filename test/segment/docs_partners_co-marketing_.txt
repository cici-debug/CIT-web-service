								Once you’re finished building an integration, we’ll launch your integration on the platform in “Beta”. You will be privately listed, and we will provide you with a hidden URL for beta customers to test your integration. Once you have 10 customers sending data to your integration via Segment, we will make your integration public in our UI and marketing sites. Our beta program is in place to ensure the integration is in tip top shape before pushing it to the wider Segment community.

								Once your integration is live, a great way to further partner with Segment is by implementing the
							Element:a
								Enable with Segment
								button in your setup flow. This asset was built to help our partners provide a seamless experience for our mutual customers, and avoids the need for our customers to copy and paste credentials to enable your integration.

								Post launch, we will monitor the growth of your integration on our platform and reach out to you should there be an opportunity to work on content, a webinar or event together. Feel free to send us ideas of ways you’d like to partner with us, but also bear in mind that we have over 200+ partners and can only participate in a handful each quarter to ensure quality.
