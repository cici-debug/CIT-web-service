					Spec: Group
			Node:

			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The
				Element:code
					group
					API call is how you associate an individual user with a group—be it a company, organization, account, project, team or whatever other crazy name you came up with for the same concept!
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					A user can be in more than one group; however, not all platforms support multiple groups. It also lets you record custom traits about the group, like industry or number of employees. Calling
				Element:code
					group
					is a slightly more advanced feature, but it’s helpful if you have accounts with multiple users.
			Node:
			(type) c

					Here’s the payload of a typical
				Element:code
					group
					call, with most
				Element:a
					common fields
					removed:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					{ "type": "group", "groupId": "0e8c78ea9d97a7b8185e8632", "traits": { "name": "Initech", "industry": "Technology", "employees": 329, "plan": "enterprise", "total billed": 830 } }
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					And here’s the corresponding Javascript event that would generate the above payload:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					analytics.group("0e8c78ea9d97a7b8185e8632", { name: "Initech", industry: "Technology", employees: 329, plan: "enterprise", "total billed": 830 });
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Beyond the common fields, the
				Element:code
					group
					call takes the following fields:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:table
				Element:tr
				Element:th
				Element:strong

				Element:td

				Element:td
					A unique identifier for the group in your database.

								Traits are pieces of information you know about a group that are passed along with the

								employees
								or
							Element:code
								website
								.
						Node:

								We’ve reserved some traits that have semantic meanings for groups, and we handle them in special ways. You should

								only use reserved traits for their intended meaning

						Node:

								The following are the reserved traits we have standardized:

								Date the group’s account was first created

								We recommend

								ISO-8601
								date strings, but also accept Unix timestamps for convenience.

								Note:
								You might be used to some integrations recognizing special properties differently. For example, Mixpanel has a special
							Element:code
								track_charges
								method for accepting revenue. Luckily, you don’t have to worry about those inconsistencies. Just pass us
							Element:code
								revenue
								.
							Element:strong
								We’ll handle all of the integration-specific conversions for you automatically.
								Same goes for the rest of the reserved properties.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Traits are case-insensitive
								, so in Javascript you can match the rest of your camel-case code by sending
							Element:code
								createdAt
								, and in Ruby you can match your snake-case code by sending
							Element:code
								created_at
								. That way the API never seems alien to your code base.
