					Can I control what data is sent to my warehouse?
			Node:

				Element:p
					Yes! For those of you who are on our
				Element:a
					business-tier
					, you can choose which data sources, collections, and properties write into your data warehouse. Once a source or property is disabled, we no longer sync data from that source. We will not, however, delete any data from your warehouse.

				Element:p
					When a source is re-enabled, we will sync all events since the last sync. You can adjust your schema in the Selective Sync menu in your Warehouse Settings.
