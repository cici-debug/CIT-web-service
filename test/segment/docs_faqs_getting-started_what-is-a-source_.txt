					What is a source?
			Node:

				Element:p
					Sources in Segment are created for each website you want to track. You don’t necessarily need to have a single source for each site, but that’s usually how they are used.
			Node:
			(type) c

				Element:p
					Sources belong to a workspace and the URL will look something like this:
				Element:a
					https://segment.com/my-workspace/sources/my-source-name/
					.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					You can create new sources using the button in the workspace view. Each source you create will have a write key which is used to send data to that source. For example, to load the JavaScript library on your page, you’ll add something like:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:pre
				Element:code
					window.analytics.load("YOUR_WRITE_KEY");
