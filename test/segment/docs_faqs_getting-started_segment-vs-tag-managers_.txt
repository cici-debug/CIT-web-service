					What is the difference between Segment and Tag Managers?
			Node:

				Element:p
					Tag managers were built before mobile existed, when companies were mostly concerned with tracking digital ad click-throughs.
			Node:

				Element:p
					Built on an older technology, tag managers inject a piece of JavaScript - or an ad pixel - into a website. They carry out rules marketers create for each tag, like firing an ad channel pixel when that network refers a website visitor. Every tag requires users to create rules. No data is stored, and no code is eliminated.

					In addition to ad networks, today’s data-driven businesses use a variety of tools to optimize their product and marketing spends. In order to a/b test copy, nurture sales leads, email customers, and provide fast support, businesses integrate variety of analytics and marketing tools. Segment makes it easy to install, try, and use them all. Tag managers focus on ad networks, and can’t support modern tools without extensive customization.

					Rather than “firing and forgetting,” Segment takes a data-centric approach to integrations. We collect your data, and understand what it means so we can map it to each integration correctly. You don’t need to set up special parameters for each tool – we do that for you. Segment works because
				Element:a
					all of these tools
					operate on the same customer data: who is on your app and what are they doing. Segment collects this data once, then translates and sends it to every tool you use. Because we store the data, we also have the ability to replay your historical data into new tools and give you acccess to your raw data in a SQL data warehouse.
