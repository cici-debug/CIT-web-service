								Getting Started

								When you toggle on Qualaroo in Segment, this is what happens:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Qualaroo‚Äôs javascript onto your page. This means you should remove Qualaroo‚Äôs snippet from your page.
							Element:li
								Qualaroo will automatically start displaying your targeted surveys, as you‚Äôve configured on Qualaroo.

								Qualaroo doesn‚Äôt technically have a

								we will call

								with a single trait
							Element:code
								'Triggered: ' + event
								set to
							Element:code

								based on the
