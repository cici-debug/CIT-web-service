					Segment makes it easy to send your data to
				Element:a
					Apptimize
					(and lots of other integrations). Once you've tracked your data through our open source
				Element:a
					libraries
					we'll translate and route your data to Apptimize in the format they understand.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Our Apptimize integration code is open sourced on Github. Feel free to check it out:

								Once the Segment library is integrated with your mobile app, toggle Apptimize on in your Segment dashboard, and fill in your Apptimize application key.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The Apptimize application key is a 31 character key, which you can find in your Apptimize app settings (
							Element:a
								https://apptimize.com/admin/settings/apps
								).
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								There is also an advanced setting to publish Apptimize experiment data to Segment.
						Node:

								The integration supports the
							Element:code
								identify
								,
							Element:code
								track
								, and
							Element:code
								screen
								methods. If you choose to automatically record screen events or track Application lifecycle events, these will also be reflected in Apptimize. You also have access to all normal Apptimize non-Segment functionality.
						Node:

								Identify
						Node:

							Element:p
								When you
							Element:code
								identify
								a user, Segment will pass that user‚Äôs information to Apptimize. The Segment
							Element:code
								userId
								field is passed to Apptimize as an Apptimize custom attribute called
							Element:code
								userId
								. Similarly Segment‚Äôs built-in traits appear in Apptimize as custom attributes, e.g.
							Element:code
								name
								,
							Element:code
								firstName
								,
							Element:code
								address
								. You can also define arbitrary traits of your choice. The integration will recognize integer attributes; all other traits will be sent as strings.

								When you

								an event, the event will be marked in Apptimize as an occurence of an Apptimize event of the same name.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								(Optional) You can also specify a value for each event, by adding a
							Element:code
								value
								property to the event when tracking. This is useful, for instance, when you want to track the price of orders each time a user clicks ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù in your app‚Äôs shopping cart.

								. If you choose to automatically record screen events, they will appear in Apptimize in the above format.
