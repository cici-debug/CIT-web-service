											Documentation
											Making API requests one by one can be inefficient and time consuming when you have a large number of documents to analyze. The **Batch Processing** endpoint provides a mechanism for analyzing documents in batch, which makes it easier to process a large number of documents at once. A successful batch job request will result in a `201 Created` HTTP status, with a Location header which indicates the URL you can poll to get the status of your submitted job. For convenience, the URL is also added to the body of the response. After receiving the status URL, you can retrieve the status of your batch job using the [Queue](doc:queue) endpoint. For a step by step example of using the batch processing feature, please refer to [this short tutorial](http://blog.aylien.com/post/84415927163/batch-processing-documents-with-text-api).
