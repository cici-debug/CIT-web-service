											Documentation
											Documents often contain mentions of entities such as **people**, **places**, **products** and **organizations**, which we collectively call Named Entities. Additionally they may also contain specific values or items such as **links**, **telephone numbers**, **email addresses**, **currency amounts** and **percentages**. To extract these entities and values from a piece of text, as well as the **keywords**, you can use the **Entity Extraction** endpoint. Entity Extraction looks at the structural patterns in a document to find and extract entities, and therefore can be error-prone. **N.B.** We recommend using both Concept and Entity Extraction together if you're looking to extract well-known entities with higher precision.
