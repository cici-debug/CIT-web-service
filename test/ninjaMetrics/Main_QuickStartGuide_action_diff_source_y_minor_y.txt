								!!!!'''Non-Player Character (NPC) (Event ID#31)'''[[#NPC]]
							Element:br
							Element:br
								Non-player characters (NPCs) are characters within the game that are not controlled by players. They have different levels of difficulty and may be either friendly or aggressive. This event records information regarding interactions between NPCs and players in the game environment. Recording NPC's also populates the dimension table for NPCs, which is later referred to for all other NPC related events. To log NPC events, you need to pass the account and character IDs; the NPC ID, name, and type; the event type and name; along with the toughness and timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID, and the minimum and maximum levels.

								This event records information regarding item purchases from an in-game store and includes details on the type of currency used. To log when a player buys a store item, you need to pass the account, character, and store IDs; the shard ID; the recipient account and character IDs; the item ID, name, and price; the currency type and value; and the timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the name of the virtual currency and the virtual currency count.

								This event records information regarding item purchases from an in-game store and includes details on the type of currency used. To log when a player buys a store item, you need to pass the account, character, and store IDs; the shard ID; the recipient account and character IDs; the item ID, name, and price; the currency type and value; and the timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the name of the virtual currency and the virtual currency count.

								!!!!'''Friend Addition (Event ID#43)'''[[#FriendAdd]]
							Element:br
							Element:br
								This event records information regarding a player adding another player as a friend, despite whether the friendship is reciprocated. To log a friend addition, you need to pass the sender account and character IDs; the receiver account and character IDs; and the timestamp.
							Element:br
							Element:br
								Please note that this is a one-way, "follow" type of addition. If Bob is accepting a friend request from Alice, and they will subsequently appear on each other's friends list, then two events should be sent. One with Alice as the sender and Bob as the recipient, and another with Bob as the sender and Alice as the recipient. If Alice is simply following Bob without any action on his part, then you only need to send a single event with Alice as the sender and Bob as the recipient.

								This event records information regarding the end of an in-game friendship. To log a friend deletion, you need to pass the sender account and character IDs; the receiver account and character IDs; along with the timestamp.
							Element:br
							Element:br
								For related information, see Friend Addition.
							Element:br
							Element:br

One with Alice as the sender and Bob as the recipient, and another with Bob as the sender and Alice as the recipient.

								Non-player characters (NPCs) are characters within the game that are not controlled by players. They have different levels of difficulty and may be either friendly or aggressive. This event records information regarding interactions between NPCs and players in the game environment. Recording NPC's also populates the dimension table for NPCs, which is later referred to for all other NPC related events. To log NPC events, you need to pass the account and character IDs; the NPC ID, name, and type; the event type and name; along with the toughness and timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID, and the minimum and maximum levels
								.

								Many games and environments have multiple instances running in parallel. In our schema, these parallel instances are referred to as shards. Shards are the same as running multiple instances of the game, or other environments, on different servers. To initialize a shard, you need to pass the shard ID and description, as well as a timestamp.

								This event records information regarding the purchase of items in the game using either real world money or virtual currency that may be exclusive to the game. To log an item transaction, you need to pass the account and character IDs; the item ID, name, and price; the currency type and currency value; the transaction type; as well as the timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID, and virtual currency type and count.
