													Element:a
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Non-player characters (NPCs) are characters within the game that are not controlled by players. They have different levels of difficulty and may be either friendly or aggressive. This event records information regarding interactions between NPCs and players in the game environment. Recording NPC's also populates the dimension table for NPCs, which is later referred to for all other NPC related events. To log NPC events, you need to pass the account and character IDs; the NPC ID, name, and type; the event type and name; along with the toughness and timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID, and the minimum and maximum levels.

														This event records information regarding a player adding another player as a friend, despite whether the friendship is reciprocated. To log a friend addition, you need to pass the sender account and character IDs; the receiver account and character IDs; and the timestamp.

														Please note that this is a one-way, "follow" type of addition. If Bob is accepting a friend request from Alice, and they will subsequently appear on each other's friends list, then two events should be sent. One with Alice as the sender and Bob as the recipient, and another with Bob as the sender and Alice as the recipient. If Alice is simply following Bob without any action on his part, then you only need to send a single event with Alice as the sender and Bob as the recipient.

														This event records information regarding when a player gains points in the game. Points are used as an indicator of how well the player is doing in the game and how far they have progressed. Typically, gaining enough points leads the player to level-up to a higher level. To log player points, you need to pass the account and character IDs, the character level, the point amount and type, along with the timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID and whether or not the points are grouped.

Recording NPC's also populates the dimension table for NPCs, which is later referred to for all other NPC related events. To log NPC events, you need to pass the account and character IDs; the NPC ID, name, and type; the event type and name; along with the toughness and timestamp.

														Non-player characters (NPCs) are characters within the game that are not controlled by players. They have different levels of difficulty and may be either friendly or aggressive. This event records information regarding interactions between NPCs and players in the game environment. Recording NPC's also populates the dimension table for NPCs, which is later referred to for all other NPC related events. To log NPC events, you need to pass the account and character IDs; the NPC ID, name, and type; the event type and name; along with the toughness and timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID, and the minimum and maximum levels.

														This event records a change in subscription type (e.g. from free play to a paid subscriber or premium player). Subscription changes are only applicable to games with subscriptions, not free-to-play (F2P) games. To log a change of subscription, you need to pass the user's account ID, subscription status and type, and a timestamp for both subscription and expiry. Optionally, you can also pass the subscription value.

														This event records information regarding when a player gains points in the game. Points are used as an indicator of how well the player is doing in the game and how far they have progressed. Typically, gaining enough points leads the player to level-up to a higher level. To log player points, you need to pass the account and character IDs, the character level, the point amount, along with the timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID and whether or not the points are grouped.

														Non-player characters (NPCs) are characters within the game that are not controlled by players. They have different levels of difficulty and may be either friendly or aggressive. This event records information regarding interactions between NPCs and players in the game environment. Recording NPC's also populates the dimension table for NPCs, which is later referred to for all other NPC related events. To log NPC events, you need to pass the account and character IDs; the shard ID; the NPC ID, name, and type; the minimum and maximum levels; the event type and name; along with the toughness and timestamp.
