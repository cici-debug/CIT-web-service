								You may send a single JSON object consisting of a single event or an array of these JSON objects. Sending multiple events in an array, referred to batch style, is preferred. It lowers the overhead of the transmission. We recommend you implement a queue within your system to achieve this. The recommended queue length is 100.

											The values used for the account_id, character_id, and shard_id keys must be initialized with the respective #9, #11, and #13 dimensional data loader Events before use in any Event payloads. Event type #9-15, 31, 35, 36 are used in initializing DIM data. REMEMBER: When not making use of a numeric key, you must put 0 for its value.
