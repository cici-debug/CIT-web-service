								!!'''OGI Category Type '''[[#ogi-category-type ]]
							Element:br
								OGIs are out-of-game interactions; something users do out in the world that you, the developer, still tracks. This is likely to be social media or forum activity, but could be anything of use.
							Element:br
								Note that these could be used with sub-category breakdowns, allowing for more specific tracking.
