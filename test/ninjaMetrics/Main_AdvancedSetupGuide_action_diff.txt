								This event records information regarding reward systems, through which rewards may be awarded for completion of a task or seniority. To log reward events, you need to pass the account and character IDs; the reward type, ID, and count; along with the timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID, and reward item type.

								This event records information regarding whether or not a player is a gold farmer, including what type of gold farmer they are (e.g. spammer, gatherer, mule, etc.). To log whether a player is a gold farmer, you need to pass the account and character ID, the farmer type, and the timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID.

								!!'''Account Management Events'''[[#AccountManagementEvents]]
							Element:br
							Element:br
								Account Management events include those events that are related to the creation, deletion, and management of a user or character account. Details on how to execute calls to log account events can be found below for each corresponding event.
							Element:br
							Element:br
							Element:br
								!!!!'''Create Account (Event ID#9)'''[[#CreateAccount]]
							Element:br
							Element:br
								This event records information regarding the creation of a new account, including the user's demographics. To log the creation of an account you need to pass the account ID and type; the user's language, country, gender, and date of birth; as well as the platform and the timestamp. Optionally, you may pass their currency balance and old account ID.

								!!!!'''Player Points (Event ID#24)'''[[#PlayerPoints]]
							Element:br
							Element:br
								This event records information regarding when a player gains points in the game. Points are used as an indicator of how well the player is doing in the game and how far they have progressed. Typically, gaining enough points leads the player to level-up to a higher level. To log player points, you need to pass the account and character IDs, the character level, the point amount and type, along with the timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID and whether or not the points are grouped.

								This event records information regarding item purchases, sales, or trades outside of the developer RMT game store. This event requires both an incoming and outgoing value, of which either can be 0. To log an economic event, you need to pass the sender and receiver account and character IDs; the item name and ID; the economic type and value; the currency type and value; along with the timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID, virtual currency type and count.

								This event records information when a player enters into combat against another player. Note that this event is only applicable for games and environments where a player is able to fight another player. To log a PVP duel, you need to pass the account and character IDs, the timestamp, and whether or not the player won. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID.

								This event records information when a player enters into combat against another player. Note that this event is only applicable for games and environments where a player is able to fight another player. To log a PVP duel, you need to pass the account and character IDs, the timestamp, and whether or not the player won. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID.

								Please note that this is a one-way, "follow" type of addition. If Bob is accepting a friend request from Alice, and they will subsequently appear on each other's friends list, then two events should be sent. One with Alice as the sender and Bob as the recipient, and another with Bob as the sender and Alice as the recipient. If Alice is simply following Bob without any action on his part, then you only need to send a single event with Alice as the sender and Bob as the recipient.

								Please note that this is a one-way, "unfollow" type of deletion. If Alice and Bob are currently in each other's friends list, and a removal from one party will cause them to be dropped from both lists, then you should send two deletion events. One with Alice as the sender and Bob as the recipient, and another with Bob as the sender and Alice as the recipient.
