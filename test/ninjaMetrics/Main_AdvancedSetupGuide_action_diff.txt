								!!'''Account Management Events'''[[#AccountManagementEvents]]
							Element:br
							Element:br
								Account Management events include those events that are related to the creation, deletion, and management of a user or character account. Details on how to execute calls to log account events can be found below for each corresponding event.
							Element:br
							Element:br
							Element:br
								!!!!'''Create Account (Event ID#9)'''[[#CreateAccount]]
							Element:br
							Element:br
								This event records information regarding the creation of a new account, including the user's demographics. To log the creation of an account you need to pass the account ID and type; the user's language, country, gender, and date of birth; as well as the platform and the timestamp. Optionally, you may pass their currency balance and old account ID.
							Element:br
							Element:br
								'''Note''': You must log the account creation information before any log or load command references the account ID.

							Element:br
							Element:br
								This event records information regarding when a player gains points in the game. Points are used as an indicator of how well the player is doing in the game and how far they have progressed. Typically, gaining enough points leads the player to level-up to a higher level. To log player points, you need to pass the account and character IDs, the character level, the point amount and type, along with the timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID and whether or not the points are grouped.

								Please note that this is a one-way, "follow" type of addition. If Bob is accepting a friend request from Alice, and they will subsequently appear on each other's friends list, then two events should be sent. One with Alice as the sender and Bob as the recipient, and another with Bob as the sender and Alice as the recipient. If Alice is simply following Bob without any action on his part, then you only need to send a single event with Alice as the sender and Bob as the recipient.

								Please note that this is a one-way, "unfollow" type of deletion. If Alice and Bob are currently in each other's friends list, and a removal from one party will cause them to be dropped from both lists, then you should send two deletion events. One with Alice as the sender and Bob as the recipient, and another with Bob as the sender and Alice as the recipient.

To initialize a shard, you need to pass the shard ID and description, as well as a timestamp.
