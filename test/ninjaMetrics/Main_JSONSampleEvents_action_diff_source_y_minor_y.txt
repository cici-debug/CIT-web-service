								Logs a Message event. A common feature in many games in the ability of players to message one another. Depending upon the game, multiple channels of communication may be used (e.g. it may be in the form of in-game chat, in-game mail, message broadcast to players in a group, etc). This event does not log any message content, just the interaction between two users.

								The Ninja Metrics JSON API allows you to push your application’s Event data into our pipeline.
							Element:br
							Element:br
								All JSON Event payloads are POSTed to the following URL base:\\
							Element:br
								https://api.ninjametrics.com/event
							Element:br
							Element:br
								All queries to server-side endpoints require the following parameters:\\
							Element:br
								?client_id=[client id from account manager]&app_id=[app id from account manager]&api_client=[self identified lib version]
							Element:br
							Element:br
								->[-For example:\\
							Element:br
								https://api.ninjametrics.com/event?client_id=100&app_id=100&app_pwd=1234567890&api_client=CoolCompany/ruby_1.2a-]
							Element:br
							Element:br
								We also collect, for deployment tracking purposes to provide better support to our customers, any data in the User-Agent HTTP header field.\\
							Element:br
							Element:br
							Element:br
								The value for the timestamp key in any Event JSON payload should always be in the ISO-8601 standard (UTC): YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ. JavaScript’s Date.toJSON() accomplishes this perfectly.\\
							Element:br
							Element:br
								-->[-For example:-]
							Element:br
								-->[-HTTPS POST https://api.ninjametrics.com/event?client_id=1&app_id=1&api_client=Spot/js_1.5.u-]

							Element:br

								The values used for the account_id, character_id, and shard_id keys must be initialized with the respective #9, #11, and #13 dimensional data loader Events before use in any Event payloads. Event type #9-15, 31, 35, 36 are used in initializing DIM data. REMEMBER: When not making use of a numeric key, you must put 0 for its value.
