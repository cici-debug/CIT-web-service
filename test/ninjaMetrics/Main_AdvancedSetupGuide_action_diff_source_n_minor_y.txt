														Please note that you should only use this event when the Item Transaction (#17) or Store Buy Item (#37) events aren't appropriate. Store Buy Item (#37) should be used in most cases of any type of currency or virtual currency transactions. If currency is being spent to acquire something, it is preferable to use those events so that the purchase can be associated with the item. Do not send the Currency Transaction event in tandem with those events, because the currency transfer will be double counted on your dashboard.

														Please note that you should only use this event when the Item Transaction (#17), Store Buy Item (#37), or Economic (#58) events aren't appropriate. Store Buy Item (#37) should be used in most cases of any type of currency or virtual currency transactions. If currency is being spent to acquire something, it is preferable to use those events so that the purchase can be associated with the item. Do not send the Currency Transaction event in tandem with those events, because the currency transfer will be double counted on your dashboard.

								Please note that this is a one-way, "follow" type of addition. If Bob is accepting a friend request from Alice, and they will subsequently appear on each other's friends list, then two events should be sent. One with Alice as the sender and Bob as the recipient, and another with Bob as the sender and Alice as the recipient. If Alice is simply following Bob without any action on his part, then you only need to send a single event with Alice as the sender and Bob as the recipient.

								Please note that this is a one-way, "unfollow" type of deletion. If Alice and Bob are currently in each other's friends list, and a removal from one party will cause them to be dropped from both lists, then you should send two deletion events. One with Alice as the sender and Bob as the recipient, and another with Bob as the sender and Alice as the recipient.

Typically, virtual currencies have an exchange rate that captures their corresponding value in real world currency, such as US Dollars, Yen, Euros, etc. To log virtual currencies, you need to pass the virtual currency label.

Initializing an item also initializes the dimension table for the item, which is later referred to for all other item related events. To initialize an item, you need to pass the item ID, name, type, and segment, as well as the timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the account and character IDs of the creator.
