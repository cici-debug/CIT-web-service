														Non-player characters (NPCs) are characters within the game that are not controlled by players. They have different levels of difficulty and may be either friendly or aggressive. This event records information regarding interactions between NPCs and players in the game environment. Recording NPC's also populates the dimension table for NPCs, which is later referred to for all other NPC related events. To log NPC events, you need to pass the account and character IDs; the NPC ID, name, and type; the event type and name; along with the toughness and timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID, and the minimum and maximum levels.

														This event records a change in subscription type (e.g. from free play to a paid subscriber or premium player). Subscription changes are only applicable to games with subscriptions, not free-to-play (F2P) games. To log a change of subscription, you need to pass the user's account ID, subscription status and type, and a timestamp for both subscription and expiry. Optionally, you can also pass the subscription value.

														Currency Transaction (Event ID#18)
													Element:a
												Node:

													Element:p
														Logs a Currency Transaction event. Covers all types of transaction in the game or any other environment where real world money was used. Designed To Handle Most Currency Transactions. More Complicated Transactions Can Be Done Within Event #37.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														This event records information regarding transactions in the game or other environments where real world money is used. To log currency transactions, you need to pass the account and character IDs, the transaction and currency types, as well as the timestamp. Optionally, you may pass the shard ID, the virtual currency label, the currency value, the virtual currency count, and the transaction description.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														One common scenario is when a user purchases virtual currency by spending real currency. In this case, you should send this event twice. Once with a TRANSACTION TYPE of 0 and a CURRENCY TYPE of 0 (the user is spending real currency), and then again with a TRANSACTION TYPE of 1 and a CURRENCY TYPE of 1, along with the appropriate VIRTUAL CURRENCY COUNT and LABEL (the user is acquiring virtual currency).
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
													Element:span
														Please note that you should only use this event when the Item Transaction (#17) or Store Buy Item (#37) events aren't appropriate. Store Buy Item (#37) should be used in most cases of any type of currency or virtual currency transactions. If currency is being spent to acquire something, it is preferable to use those events so that the purchase can be associated with the item. Do not send the Currency Transaction event in tandem with those events, because the currency transfer will be double counted on your dashboard.
