								Introduction
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Welcome to the Brightbox Cloud API! The API allows you to programmatically control the computing resources available to your account.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								It currently allows management of the following resources:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:a
								Servers
								- virtualised compute instances in a range of capabilities (
							Element:a
								Server Types
								)
							Element:li
							Element:a
								Server Groups
								- collections of servers
							Element:li
							Element:a
								Load Balancers
								- for dividing network traffic across multiple Servers
							Element:li
							Element:a
								Cloud IPs
								- dynamic public IP addresses that can be moved between Servers or Load Balancers
							Element:li
							Element:a
								Images
								- uploaded disk images or snapshots made from existing services
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In addition it allows management of some aspects of your User, Account and API client details.

											Requirements to use the service
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In order to use the Brightbox Cloud service and the API you must have a valid User profile and an Account which has been successfully verified.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											New users can sign up to the service at
										Element:a
											https://manage.brightbox.com
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you were a user during the beta period of the service, you should have received instructions about how to upgrade your profile and account details to gain full access.

											Users and Accounts
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In the Brightbox Cloud we differentiate between a User, a person who uses the site, and an Account which is where costs and resources are managed.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											A User must agree to the terms and conditions to use the service. An Account must be setup with a valid payments card and be verified by telephone.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											At the present time we are limiting each User to having one Account. This may change in the future to allow multiple users to manage one Account and a User having several Accounts.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The best way to manage your user and account details are using the management control panel at
										Element:a
											https://manage.brightbox.com

										Element:h3
											Regions and Zones
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											We divide our service into two geographical layers. Regions are larger areas which contain several Zones. Zones are roughly equivalent to data centres. Zones however are completely independent of each other.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The Brightbox API is currently regional. So you can interact with several Zones through the API.

										Element:h3
											Resource IDs
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											All resources have a unique and immutable ID. These consist of a three letter code, a dash and approximately five alphanumeric characters. The characters are actually a number encoded as Base36 to save on typing. As such the number range may expand and become longer.

								API tools and client libraries
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2

											We provide a set of command line tools to access and manage most of the resources. Details are available at the
										Element:a
											documentation
											site.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The CLI tools are available as either a Ruby gem or a Ubuntu/Debian package.

											The Brightbox Cloud API uses
										Element:a
											semantic versioning
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The current version of the API is
										Element:strong
											1.0.0beta
											but the URL only includes the major and minor parts of the version number
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To use a particular version of the API, add it to the base API endpoint URL e.g
										Element:strong
											api.gb1.brightbox.com/1.0/

											DateTime and Timezone
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											All Times are stored and reported in UTC. The ISO8601 format (e.g. 2011-09-13T16:09:54Z) is used throughout the API. The DateTimes are returned as strings since JSON does not have a DateTime object in the specification.

											https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749
											requesting an access token using either the
										Element:strong
											client_credentials
											,
										Element:strong
											password

										Element:td
											This is a full view of the resource. All of the attributes are included and linked resources appear in the output as well
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											Nested
										Element:td
											This is a shorter representation that is used when this resource is beneath another full resource. A nested resource is secondary data to the main resource being accessed
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											Collected
										Element:td
											This is used when the resource is a member of a collection. It is shorter than the full response since many may be returned in one go
									Node:

														Nested representation
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Nested representations are shorter summaries of a resource intended to appear beneath a main resource.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														A nested resource is named using the relationship between the two resources.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														When a resource is collected to a number of other resources, this collection is represented using the nested representations rather than a collection representation.

														Collected representation
												Node:
												(type) c

													Element:p
														Collected representations are used when the resource is a member of a collection. Some details are omitted since several sets of results are expected to be returned and including full details would create very large responses.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														A collection representation is wrapped in an Array in the returned JSON response. This allows iteration across the collection.

											Collaboration
									Node:

										Element:p
											A collaboration forms the link between an Account and a User, giving the User access to the specified Account. As a collaboration is created, the User is invited to accept the collaboration via email. The collaboration can be accepted or rejected via the User Collaboration’s accept or reject methods. Once the collaboration is complete either party can end the collaboration. Account administrators can call delete on the Collaboration or the User can call delete on the User Collaboration.
