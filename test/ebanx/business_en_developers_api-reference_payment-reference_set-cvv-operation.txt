					The setCVV operation is used to temporary associate a CVV with an existing
				Element:a
					token
					. This CVV will be used by the next request made with the associated token and then discarded.
				Element:p
					The setCVV operation is useful for one-click payments, where you already have the customer’s credit card information and cannot send the CVV from your server.
				Element:p
					For this method, you will need to wrap the request paratemers in a JSON object and send them as the value of a parameter called
				Element:code
					request_body
					. You can view some practical examples on our
				Element:a
					API guides section
					.
				Element:h2
					Request parameters
				Element:p
					public_integration_key
				Element:p
					string, length 100, required
				Element:p
