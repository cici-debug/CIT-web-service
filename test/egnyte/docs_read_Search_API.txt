					Search API

					The Search API allows you to find content stored in Egnyte based on filenames, metadata, and text content. Searches are performed in the context of the user token being passed. Accordingly, a user will only see results for contents they have permission to access. The search API has been extended to support searching for metadata fields in files, versions, or folders. When searching metadata, call the API with a POST request to /pubapi/v1/search with a JSON body.
