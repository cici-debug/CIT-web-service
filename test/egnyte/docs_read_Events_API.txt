					Events API
			Node:

				Element:p
					The Events API lets your application learn about activity in Egnyte. This means you can find out what has happened since a given moment in time, letting your application respond or react to activity. Currently, this API is in beta and is limited to file system and notes activity. We will progressively add more event types. If you have a need for a specific event type, please email
				Element:a
					api-support@egnyte.com
					to tell us about your use case.

				Element:strong
					Note: the event stream exposed by this Events API stores the latest 300,000 events, up to a maximum of 30 days. Older events are not accessible via this API.

											Polling
									Node:

										Element:p
											Our Events API supports polling for changes based on a cursor which indicates a position in the sequence of events that have occurred on your domain. The cursor is a monotonically increasing number that is associated with each event recorded in our global event store. To watch for events, you should get a cursor and periodically poll for new events which have occurred after that event's cursor.

																Element:span
																	folder
																Element:td
																	You can optionally scope requests to a given folder. When this parameter is specified, we will return events that have occurred at this path.

																Element:tr
																Element:td
																Element:span
																	type
																Element:td
																	Limit the result set to only items of a certain type. Currently, this endpoint only supports the "file_system" and "note" types. To get multiple event types, you can use a pipe ("|") character to delimit them. For example "file_system|note" would return both file_system and note event types but no others.
