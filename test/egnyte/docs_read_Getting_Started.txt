					The Egnyte Public API lets you create applications that securely interact with Egnyte in the following ways:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
					Access, modify, and search for file system content
				Element:li
					Manage users and groups
				Element:li
					Generate audit reports
				Element:li
					Create and manage file and folder links
			Node:

					Our APIs are RESTful in nature and adhere to the following standards:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
					API request and response bodies are JSON formatted. Be sure to set the "Content-Type: application/json" header on requests that have bodies.
				Element:li
					All strings must be UTF-8 encoded.
				Element:li
					All API calls must be made over HTTPS to ensure security.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					File uploads and downloads through the API are limited by the maximum file size allowed for your Egnyte account.

											Base API Path
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3

											Except for authentication, all API calls to your domain share the following base URL.
											https://{Egnyte Domain}.egnyte.com/pubapi/
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Following the base path, you will need to indicate the API version you are using. Currently, all endpoints are v1, except for the User and Group Management endpoints which are v2.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When accessing the Public API you must use

											{Egnyte Domain}.egnyte.com
											(e.g. mycompany.egnyte.com) and not a custom access URL (e.g. files.mycompany.com).

												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														To start using the Public APIs, you need to
													Element:a
														register for a developer account
														and create an application. A key will be generated for each application automatically but will need to be approved before you can use it. We aim to respond to API key requests within a few hours but it may take up to one business day. Also, please look out for e-mails from a member of our team since we'll let you know when your key is approved or if we have any questions.
												Node:

												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Please note the following rules when registering for an API key:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:ul
													Element:li
														The API key must be associated with the domain name you wish to convert into a free partner account.
													Element:li
														You must describe the purpose of the application.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Once logged into your profile, you can see your current keys under My Account -> Keys. If you already have an account, you can register additional keys by navigating to My Account -> Applications -> Create a New Application.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														When registering for an application, you will be asked specify if your application will be a Publicly Available Application or an Internal Application. If you are writing an application for your own company's internal use or are contracted to create a solution for a single company, you should select an Internal Application key. Otherwise, you should select the option for a Publicly Available Application. You will also be asked to provide your Egnyte domain (e.g. apidemo for apidemo.egnyte.com). If you are creating a Publicly Available Applicaiton, you will need to set an OAuth Redirect URI. Don't worry, if you change your mind, you can edit the Redirect URI in your developer account profile.

											Initially, your API key will only work for the Egnyte domain you specified when registering your application. Once we approve your app for production, this restriction will be lifted. When your app is ready to be released, please e-mail
										Element:a
											partners@egnyte.com
											to start the approval process. Please note that the review takes a few days and may take longer if something needs to be revised.

											Our approval process is pretty simple:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ol
										Element:li
											Demo your app for us or grant us access to a demo account for your app.
										Element:li
											Test your app's workflow with Egnyte from the perspective of a normal end user, and let us know the time window for your testing and the Egnyte domain you are using. We will review the logs to make sure there are no abnormalities.
										Element:li
											There is no step 3. If you followed steps 1 and 2, you should be good to go!

										Element:p
											The Egnyte Public APIs are frequently being enhanced. These enhancements may add new endpoints as well as new parameters or headers to existing endpoints. However, unless we notice a security issue or other critical problem, we will not make changes that remove or modify existing, documented fields. Though uncommon, we sometimes expose certain undocumented features on a temporary or provisional basis. If you notice an undocumented feature and wish to use it in your code, please check with
										Element:a
											API support
											before depending on it.
