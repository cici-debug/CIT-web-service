					Audit Reporting API
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					The Audit Reporting API allows you to programmatically generate and retrieve reports on login activity, file actions, and permission changes. The scope of these reports effectively gives you a 360° view of the activity in your account.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Note that the endpoint for the Audit Reporting API should always begin like this:
					https://{Egnyte Domain}.egnyte.com
			Node:

					Specific endpoints are listed with each method.

											Retrieving Audit Reports
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Audit reports are generated asynchronously. After submitting a POST to trigger report generation, a reference to a job resource is returned. This job resource should be periodically polled (but no more frequently than once every 2 minutes) to track the generation status. The job resource will return HTTP code 200 with status message indicating “running” while the report is being generated. Once the report is ready, the job resource will return a 303 HTTP code with a reference to the URI for the completed report.
