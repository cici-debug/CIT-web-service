					Our API will forward each incoming message to a server of your choosing by making a simple HTTP GET or POST request. All the parameters will be URL-Encoded UTF-8 text. Your server needs to respond with a 200 OK status code to acknowledge receipt of the message, otherwise the API will retry at regular intervals.
