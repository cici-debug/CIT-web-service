					Delivery receipts let you know whether a message has been delivered. We forward them to you by making an HTTP request to a URL of your choice. Your server must respond with a 200, OK, status code to indicate successful processing of the delivery receipt.

												Node:

													Element:p
														Sent to your server using a standard HTTP GET. When sending an SMS set DlrContent to the query string you would like to receive, use the

												Node:

													Element:p
														The bulk delivery receipt option will send you up to 100 delivery receipts in a single HTTP request. For customers sending large volumes of messages, this speeds up receipts as it removes the overhead of creating many separate connections and may reduce the load on your server. As a result of this improved efficiency there a couple of restrictions, the content cannot be customised and you must reply to each delivery receipt. It’s important to note that using the bulk XML option will never slow down your delivery receipts, if they’re slowly trickling in one at a time from the mobile network we’ll forward them as soon as they arrive rather than wait for a batch to build up.
