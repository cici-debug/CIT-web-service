								It’s your data not ours, so we take our responsibility seriously. There are two copies of the live data and a further two read only copies created a fraction of a second behind the original. Just in case that’s not enough we also take two additional backup copies each evening and maintain a copy of the data at a hosting site away from the main operating platform.

								Rather than having redundant servers waiting for a problem, we get them all working to ensure you get the most efficient product possible. To ensure optimal uptime we split the platform over multiple sites with multiple servers for each task, but the whole thing works as a single unit. It means hard discs, servers, or whole sites can go down and you won’t feel a thing.

								We use the best Cisco ASA firewalls and always implement the latest security patches to keep the uninvited out. All our products are password protected and the API can be locked down to IP address or secured via VPN networks. If your name’s not down you’re not coming in.
