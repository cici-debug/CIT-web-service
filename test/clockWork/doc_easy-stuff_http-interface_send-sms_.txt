													Element:p
														The text or phone number displayed when a text message is received on a phone. This can be either a 12 digit number or 11 characters long. You can set a default by
													Element:a
														logging in
														to Clockwork. If you’re sending with a text from address and your message isn’t delivered try again but change to sending from a telephone number - some international networks place restrictions on the from addresses they’ll accept. Due to US telecomunications rules you’re unable to set the from address when sending to the USA - the text will always come from 43704.
