											What are the Batch APIs?
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											With
										Element:strong
											Batch RESTful APIs
											you can easily create push campaigns and take advantage of Batch’s advanced features from your own systems. There are basically two APIs you can use in your app to cover all your marketing needs:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											The
										Element:a
											Campaigns API
											allows you to send push notifications in mass to your
										Element:strong
											segments
										Element:em
											(attributes, events)
											or to segments generated by Batch
										Element:em
											(country/language, dormant users, app version, etc)
											.
										Element:li
											The
										Element:a
											Transactional API
											allows you to send notifications to a
										Element:strong
											specific token
											or custom user ID based on events in your back-end
										Element:em
											(e.g. "You have a new friend request")
											.

														Request headers
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														You will need to use the same api keys and headers for both the campaigns or the transactional API. Here is an example of a valid request syntax:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Authorization: BATCH_REST_API_KEY" -X POST -d "@payload.json" "https://api.batch.com/1.1/BATCH_API_KEY/campaigns/create"
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Authorization: BATCH_REST_API_KEY" -X GET "https://api.batch.com/1.1/BATCH_API_KEY/campaigns/stats/CAMPAIGN_TOKEN"
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:ul
													Element:li
													Element:code
														BATCH_REST_API_KEY
														is your
													Element:strong
														REST API key
														. It goes in the
													Element:code
														X-Authorization
														header.
													Element:li
													Element:code
														BATCH_API_KEY
														is you
													Element:strong
														app API key
														. It is the one that goes in the URL.
