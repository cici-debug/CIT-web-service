									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Authorization: BATCH_REST_API_KEY" -X GET "https://api.batch.com/1.1/BATCH_API_KEY/campaigns/stats/CAMPAIGN_TOKEN"

										Element:code
											{ "campaign_token": "aae13559e0493c0b350c547533f5b28f", "detail": [{ "date": "2016-03-29", "sent": 972, "direct_open": 98, "influenced_open": 75, "reengaged": 36, "errors": 0, "versions": { "a": { "sent": 486, "direct_open": 67, "influenced_open": 46, "reengaged": 24 }, "b": { "sent": 486, "direct_open": 31, "influenced_open": 29, "reengaged": 12 } } }] }

											You can use this information to show the
										Element:a
											results of your campaigns
											in your business intelligence tools.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Also, you can easily calculate the
										Element:strong
											open-rate
											by using the following formula:
										Element:br
										Element:strong
											open-rate
											= (
										Element:code
											direct_open
											+
										Element:code
											influenced_open
											) /
										Element:code
