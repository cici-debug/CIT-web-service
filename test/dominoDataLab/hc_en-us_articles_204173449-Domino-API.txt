					Domino API
			Node:

			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Much of Domino's functionality is available programmatically through our HTTP API and our Python binding.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Note that this is different from our
				Element:a
					API Endpoints
					functionality:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ul
				Element:li
					API Endpoints let you publish your code as a low-latency web service.
				Element:li
					The Domino REST API lets you control Domino's functionality (e.g., starting and monitoring runs) programmatically.

								Python Bindings
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The Python binding for the Domino is installable via pip:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								pip install git+https://github.com/dominodatalab/python-domino.git
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can find Domino's public Python bindings project
							Element:a
								here
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once installed, you'll need to get your API key from your
							Element:a
								Account page
								. The Python library will read this key from environment variables, so set it as follows in your shell:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								export DOMINO_USER_API_KEY=
							Element:span
								YOUR_API_KEY
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you are using the Python package in code that is already running in Domino, the DOMINO_API_USER_KEY variable will be set automatically to be the key for the user who started the run.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Here is an example of usage:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								from domino import Domino # By and large your commands will run against a single project, # so you must specify the full project name domino = Domino("chris/canon") # List all runs in the project, most-recently queued first all_runs = domino.runs_list()['data'] latest_100_runs = all_runs[0:100] print(latest_100_runs) # all runs have a commitId (the snapshot of the project when the # run starts) and, if the run completed, an "outputCommitId" # (the snapshot of the project after the run completed) most_recent_run = all_runs[0] commitId = most_recent_run['outputCommitId'] # list all the files in the output commit ID -- only showing the # entries under the results directory. If not provided, will # list all files in the project. Or you can say path=“/“ to # list all files files = domino.files_list(commitId, path='results/')['data'] for file in files: print file['path'], '->', file['url'] print(files) # Get the content (i.e. blob) for the file you're interested in. # blobs_get returns a connection rather than the content, because # the content can get quite large and it’s up to you how you want # to handle it print(domino.blobs_get(files[0]['key']).read()) # Start a run of file main.py using the latest copy of that file domino.runs_start(["main.py", "arg1", "arg2"]) # Start a "direct" command domino.runs_start(["echo 'Hello, World!'"], isDirect=True) # Start a run of a specific commit domino.runs_start(["main.py"], commitId="aabbccddee")
