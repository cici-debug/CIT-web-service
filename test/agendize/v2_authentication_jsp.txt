				Element:li
					Use authentication with
				Element:span

											Overview
									Node:

										Element:p
											OAuth2 is an authentication process allows your application to get a valid access token linked to a specific Agendize account. To authenticate your application, you will join the access token to your API requests (see "Usage" section for more).
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											How it works:
										Element:br
											First, the final user will authorize your app that will allow you to get an access token and a refresh token. If the access token expires, you will use the refresh token to renew the access token.

											How to get a valid access token
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When you register an Application in Agendize, we provide a Client ID and a Client Secret for this application.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:span
											Important
										Element:br
											The Client ID is considered public information, however the Client Secret must be kept confidential.

											Once your application has the OAuth2 authentication process implemented, you will have a valid access token that your application must join as URL parameters to all API calls.
