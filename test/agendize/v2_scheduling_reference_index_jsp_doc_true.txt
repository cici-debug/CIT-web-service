					The Online Scheduling API empowers you to manage your business activities and to create online scheduling buttons to install through your web presence. This API reference is organized around several objects with a hierarchy and dependencies:
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:ol
				Element:li
					Company/ies
				Element:ol
				Element:li
					Their services or resources
				Element:li
					Their staff
				Element:li
					Appointments
			Node:

			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Agendize Online Scheduling can be set up in one of two modes: service mode or resource mode. Thus, appointments can link a client with a service and a staff or a client with a resource.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					To create clients, refer to the
				Element:a
					Clients CRM API reference
					.
			Node:
			(type) c
			(layer)1
				Element:p
					Once you get your hands on those objects, you can experience further this API with the next objects: settings, widget and scheduling buttons.
