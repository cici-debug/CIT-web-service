								The Job Queue executes automated tasks in Sugar through a scheduler, which integrates with external UNIX systems and Windows systems to run jobs that are scheduled through those systems. Jobs are the individual runs of the specified function from a scheduler.
						Node:

							Element:p
								The Job Queue is composed of the following parts:
						Node:

							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								SugarJobQueue
								: Implements the queue functionality. The queue contains the various jobs.
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								SchedulersJob
								: A single instance of a job. This represents a single executable task and is held in the SugarJobQueue.
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								Scheduler
								: This is a periodically occurring job.
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								SugarCronJobs
								: The cron process that uses SugarJobQueue to run jobs. It runs periodically and does not support parallel execution.

											Schedule Stage
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:p
											On the scheduling stage (
										Element:code
											checkPendingJobs
											in Scheduler class), the queue checks if any schedules are qualified to run at this time and do not have job instance already in the queue. If such schedules exist, a job instance will immediately be created for each.

								Schedulers
							Element:p
								Sugar provides a Scheduler service that can execute predefined functions asynchronously on a periodic basis. The Scheduler integrates with external UNIX systems and Windows systems to run jobs that are scheduled through those systems. The typical configuration is to have a UNIX cron job or a Windows scheduled job execute the Sugar Scheduler service every couple of minutes. The Scheduler service checks the list of Schedulers defined in the Scheduler Admin screen and executes any that are currently due.

								Scheduler Jobs
