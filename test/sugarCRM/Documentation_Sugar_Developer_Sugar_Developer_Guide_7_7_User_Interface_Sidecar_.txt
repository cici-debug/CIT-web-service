								Overview
						Node:

								Sidecar is a platform that moves processing to the client side to render pages as single-page web apps. Sidecar contains a complete Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework based on the Backbone.js library.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								By creating a single-page web app, server load drastically decreases while the client's performance increases because the application is sending pure JSON data in place of HTML. The JSON data, returned by the v10 API, defines the application's modules, records, and ACLs, allowing UI processing to happen on the client side and significantly reducing the amount of data to transfer.

											Components
									Node:

										Element:p
											Everything that is renderable on the page is a component. A layout is a component that serves as a canvas for one or more views and other layouts. All pages will have at least one master layout, and that master layout can contain multiple nested layouts.

														Layouts
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Layouts are components that render the overall page. They define the rows, columns, and fluid layouts of content that gets delivered to the end user.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Example layouts include:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:ul
													Element:li
														Rows
													Element:li
														Columns
													Element:li
														Bootstrap fluid layouts
													Element:li
														Drawers and dropdowns

														Views
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Views are components that render data from a context and may or may not include field components. Example views include not only record and list views but also widgets such as:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:ul
													Element:li
														Graphs or other data visualizations
													Element:li
														External data views such as Twitter, LinkedIn, or other web service integrations
													Element:li
														The global header
												Node:

														Fields
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Fields render widgets for individual values that have been pulled from the models and also handle formatting (or stripping the formatting of) field values. Like layouts and views, fields extend Backbone views.

											Context
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											A Context is a container for the relevant data for a page, and it has three major attributes:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
										Element:strong
											Module
											: The name of the module this context is based on
										Element:li
										Element:strong
											Model
											: The primary or selected model for this context
										Element:li
										Element:strong
											Collection
											: The set of models currently loaded in this context
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Contexts are used to retrieve related data and to paginate through lists of data.
