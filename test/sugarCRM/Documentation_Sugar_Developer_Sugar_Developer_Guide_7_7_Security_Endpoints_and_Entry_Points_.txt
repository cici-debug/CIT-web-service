								Description
						Node:

							Element:p
								SugarCRM has both legacy entry points and REST API endpoints which are shipped out of the box. Not every customer uses all capabilities of the SugarCRM product. To harden the configuration both entry points can be disabled based on the customer's requirements.

								Legacy Entry Points
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								All stock entry points are defined in include/MVC/Controller/entry_point_registry.php. Using the SugarCRM Extension framework the configuration directives can be overridden in an upgrade safe manner. As an example consider the entrypoint "removeme". To disable this entrypoint use the following procedure.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Create a new php file ./custom/Extension/application/Ext/EntryPointRegistry/disable_removeme.php and add the following content:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								<?php if (isset($entry_point_registry['removeme'])) { unset($entry_point_registry['removeme']); }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Execute a quick repair and rebuild as SugarCRM administrator. The entry point is now fully disabled and no longer accessible to respond to any calls. Note that when trying to hit an non-existing (or disabled) entry point, the application will redirect you to the homepage (or login screen if the user has no session).

						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Create a new php file custom/clients/base/api/CustomHelpApi.php and add the following content:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								<?php require_once 'clients/base/api/HelpApi.php'; class CustomHelpApi extends HelpApi { public function getHelp($api, $args) { throw new SugarApiExceptionNotFound(); } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Execute a quick repair and rebuild as SugarCRM administrator. The entry point is now fully disabled. When making a REST API call to /rest/v10/help the following will be returned:
