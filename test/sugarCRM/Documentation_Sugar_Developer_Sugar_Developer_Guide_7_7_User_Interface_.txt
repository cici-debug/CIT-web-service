								Sugar's user interface is dependent on the client (i.e. base, mobile, or portal) being used to access the system. Clients are the various platforms that use Sugar's APIs to render the user interface. Each platform type will have a specific path for its components. While the Developer Guide mainly covers the
							Element:a
								base client type
								, the following sections will outline the various metadata locations.
