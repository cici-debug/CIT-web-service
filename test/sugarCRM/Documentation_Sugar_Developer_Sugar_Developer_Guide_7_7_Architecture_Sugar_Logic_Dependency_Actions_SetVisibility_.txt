								Overview

							Element:p
								The SugarLogic
							Element:code
								SetVisibility
								action, located in
							Element:code
								./include/Expressions/Actions/VisibilityAction.php
								, is used to determine the visibility logic of a field based on a formula.

								Implementation
						Node:

							Element:p
								While the dependency metadata for your module can be defined in
							Element:code
								./modules/<module>/metadata/dependencydefs.php
								and
							Element:code
								./custom/modules/<module>/metadata/dependencydef.php
								, it is recommended to use the
							Element:a
								extension framework
								when customizing stock modules to prevent third party plugins from conflicting with your customizations. The following section will demonstrate how to implement a read-only dependency.

											SetVisibility Dependency Extensions
									Node:

										Element:p
											For our example, we will create a dependency on the Accounts module that shows the
										Element:code
											phone_alternate
											field when the
										Element:code
											phone_office
											field has been populated. An example is shown below.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											./custom/Extension/modules/<module>/Ext/Dependencies/custom_phone_alternate.php
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											<?php $dependencies['Accounts']['phone_alternate_hide'] = array( 'hooks' => array("edit"), 'triggerFields' => array('phone_office'), 'onload' => true, //Actions is a list of actions to fire when the trigger is true 'actions' => array( array( 'name' => 'SetVisibility', 'params' => array( 'target' => 'phone_alternate', 'value' => 'not(equal($phone_office,""))', ), ), ), );
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Once you have the file in place, you will need to navigate to Admin > Repairs > and run a Quick Repair and Rebuild.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											Note
											: It is important that the module name is plural ('Accounts' vs. 'Account') and that the name of the dependency, "phone_alternate_hide" in this example, is unique.

											Visibility Dependencies in Field Definitions
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Unlike several of the other dependencies,
										Element:code
											SetVisibility
											is built into Studio. So this dependency can be set as a custom vardef value or in the varefs file for a new module. If you wanted to add this dependency to an existing field then you could add a file to
										Element:code
											./custom/Extension/modules/<module>/Ext/Vardefs/
											. An example is shown below.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To accomplish this, we will create an extension in
										Element:code
											./custom/Extension/modules/Accounts/Ext/Vardefs/
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											./custom/Extension/modules/Accounts/Ext/Vardefs/phone_alternate.php
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											<?php $dictionary['Account']['fields']['phone_alternate']['dependency']='not(equal($phone_office,""))
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Next, you will need to navigate to Admin > Repairs > and run a Quick Repair and Rebuild. Once that is done, you can enter a value into
										Element:code
											phone_office
											and the
										Element:code
											phone_alternate
											field will show up once you tab out of the
										Element:code
											phone_office
											field. If you were coding a custom module with new fields, then you would just include it in the modules
										Element:code
											vardefs.php
											file as shown below
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											<?php $dictionary['myModule'] = array( ... 'fields' => array( ... 'phone_alternate' => array( 'name' => 'phone_alternate', 'vname' => 'LBL_PHONE_ALTERNATE', 'type' => 'varchar', 'len' => 10, 'dependency'=> 'not(equal($phone_office,""))', 'comment' => 'Other Phone Number', 'merge_filter' => 'enabled', ), ... ) ... );
