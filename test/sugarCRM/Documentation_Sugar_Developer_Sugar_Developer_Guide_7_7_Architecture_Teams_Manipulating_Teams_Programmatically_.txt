								Fetching Teams
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To fetch teams related to a bean, you will need to retrieve an instance of a TeamSet object and use the getTeams() method to retrieve the teams using the team_set_id. An example is shown below:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								//Create a TeamSet bean - no BeanFactory require_once('modules/Teams/TeamSet.php'); $teamSetBean = new TeamSet(); //Retrieve the bean $bean = BeanFactory::getBean($module, $record_id); //Retrieve the teams from the team_set_id $teams = $teamSetBean->getTeams($bean->team_set_id);

								Adding Teams
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To add a team to a bean, you will need to load the teams relationship and use the add() method. This method accepts an array of team ids to add. An example is shown below:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								//Retrieve the bean $bean = BeanFactory::getBean($module, $record_id); //Load the team relationship $bean->load_relationship('teams'); //Add the teams $bean->teams->add( array( $team_id_1, $team_id_2 ) );

										Element:ul

											If adding teams in a logic hook, the recommended approach is to use an after_save hook rather than a before_save hook as the $_REQUEST may reset any changes you make.

								Removing Teams
						Node:

								To remove a team from a bean, you will need to load the teams relationship and use the remove() method. This method accepts an array of team ids to remove. An example is shown below:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								//Retrieve the bean $bean = BeanFactory::getBean($module, $record_id); //Load the team relationship $bean->load_relationship('teams'); //Remove the teams $bean->teams->remove( array( $team_id_1, $team_id_2 ) );

								Replacing Team Sets
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To replace all of the teams related to a bean, you will need to load the teams relationship and use the replace() method. This method accepts an array of team ids. An example is shown below:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								//Retrieve the bean $bean = BeanFactory::getBean($module, $record_id); //Load the team relationship $bean->load_relationship('teams'); //Set the primary team $bean->team_id = $team_id_1 //Replace the teams $bean->teams->replace( array( $team_id_1, $team_id_2 ) ); //Save to update primary team $bean->save()

											If replacing teams in a logic hook, the recommended approach is to use an after_save hook rather than a before_save hook as the $_REQUEST or workflow may reset any changes you make.
										Element:li
											This method does not replace (or set) the primary team for the record. When replacing teams, you need to also make sure that the primary team, determined by the team_id field, is set appropriately and included in the replacement ids. If this is being done in a logic hook you should set the primary team in a before_save hook and replace the team set in the after_save hook.

											//before save function function before_save_hook($bean, $event, $arguments) { $bean->team_id = $team_id_1; } //after save function function after_save_hook($bean, $event, $arguments) { $bean->teams->replace( array( $team_id_1, $team_id_2 ) ); }

								Creating and Retrieving Team Set IDs
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To create or retrieve the team_set_id for a group of teams, you will need to retrieve an instance of a TeamSet object and use the addTeams() method. If a team set does not exist, this method will create it and return an id. An example is below:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								//Create a TeamSet bean - no BeanFactory require_once('modules/Teams/TeamSet.php'); $teamSetBean = new TeamSet(); //Retrieve/create the team_set_id $team_set_id = $teamSetBean->addTeams( array( $team_id_1, $team_id_2 ) );
