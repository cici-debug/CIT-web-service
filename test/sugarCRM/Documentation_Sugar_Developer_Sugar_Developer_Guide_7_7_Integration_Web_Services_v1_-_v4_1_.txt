								SOAP VS REST
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								There are significant differences between how the legacy REST and SOAP protocols function on an implementation level (e.g. Performance, response size, etc). Deciding which protocol to use is up to the individual developer and is beyond the scope of this guide. Starting in SugarCRM version 6.2.0, there are some deviations between the protocols with the v4 API. There are additional core calls that are only made available through the REST protocol. They are listed below:

								REST
						Node:

								REST stands for 'Representational State Transfer'. This protocol is used by Sugar to exchange information both internally and externally.

											How do I access the REST service?
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The legacy REST services in SugarCRM and be found by navigating to:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											http://{site url)/service/{version}/rest.php
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Where 'site url' is the URL of your Sugar instance and 'version' is the latest version of the API specific to your release of Sugar. You can find out more about versioning in the
										Element:a
											Web Services
											documentation.

											Input / Output Datatypes
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The default input / output datatype for REST is JSON / PHP serialize.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											These datatype files, SugarRestJSON.php and SugarRestSerialize.php, are in:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											./service/core/REST/
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:h4
														Defining your own Datatypes
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														You can also define you own datatype. To do this, you need to create a new file such as:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
														./service/core/REST/SugarRest<CustomDataType>.php
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Next, you will need to override generateResponse() and serve() functions. The Serve function decodes or unserializes the appropriate datatype based on the input type; the generateResponse function encodes or serializes it based on the output type.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														See service/test.html for more examples on usage. In this file, the getRequestData function, which generates URL with json, is both the input_type and the response_type. That is, the request data from the JavaScript to the server is JSON and response data from server is also JSON. You can mix and match any datatype as input and output. For example, you can have JSON as the input_type and serialize as the response_type based on your application's requirements.

														WS-I 1.0 Compliancy
												Node:

														Sugar supports generating a URL that is WS-I compliant. When accessing the soap entry point, you can access the WSDL at:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
												Node:

												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														By default, the WSDL is formatted as rpc/encoded, however, this can be changed by specifying a 'style' and 'use' url-paramater. An example of this is:
