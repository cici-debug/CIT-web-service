								Sugar, which is fully internationalized and localizable, differentiates languages with unique language keys. These keys prefix the files that correspond with particular languages. For example, the default language for the application is English (US), which is represented by the language key en_us. Any file that contains data specific to the English (US) language begins with the characters en_us. Language label keys that are not recognized will default to the English (US) version.

								For more information on language keys, please refer to the
							Element:a
								Languages
								page.

									Node:

										Element:p
											The module language strings are stored in
										Element:code
											$mod_strings
											. This section explains how the
										Element:code
											$mod_strings
											are compiled. All modules, whether out-of-box or custom, will have an initial set of language files in
										Element:code
											./modules/<module>/language/<language key>.lang.php
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											As you work with the system and modify labels through Studio, changes to the labels are reflected in the corresponding module's custom extension directory:
										Element:code
											./custom/Extension/modules/<module>/Ext/Language/<language key>.lang.php
											.

											Customizing Labels
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you are developing a customization and want to be able to create new or override existing label values, you will need to work within the extension modules directory. To do this, create ./custom/Extension/modules/<module>/Ext/Language/<language key>.<unique_name>.php.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The file should contain your override values with each label index set individually. An example of this is:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											<?php $mod_strings['LBL_KEY'] = 'My Display Label';
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Once the file is created with your adjustments, navigate to Admin > Repair > Quick Rebuild & Repair. This will compile all of the Extension files from
										Element:code
											./custom/Extension/modules/<module>/Ext/Language/
											to
										Element:code
											./custom/modules/<module>/Ext/Language/<language key>.lang.ext.php
											.

											Label Cache
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The file locations discussed above are compiled into the cache directory,
										Element:code
											./cache/modules/<module>/language/<language key>.lang.php
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The cached results of these files make up each module's
										Element:code
											$mod_strings
											definition.

											Retrieving Labels
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											There are two ways to retrieve a label. The first is to use the
										Element:code
											translate()
											function found in
										Element:code
											include/utils.php
											. This function will retrieve the label for the current user's language and can also be used to retrieve labels from
										Element:code
											$mod_strings
											,
										Element:code
											$app_strings
											, or
										Element:code
											app_list_strings
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											An example of this is:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											require_once('include/utils.php'); $label = translate('LBL_KEY', 'Accounts');
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Alternatively, you can use the global variable
										Element:code
											$mod_strings
											as follows:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											global $mod_strings; $label = ''; if (isset($mod_strings['LBL_KEY'])) { $label = $mod_strings['LBL_KEY']; }
