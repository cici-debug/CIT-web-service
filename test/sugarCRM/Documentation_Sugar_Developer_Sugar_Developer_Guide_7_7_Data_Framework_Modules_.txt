								Module Definitions
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The module definitions, defined in
							Element:code
								./include/modules.php
								, determine how modules are displayed and used throughout the application. Any custom metadata, whether from a plugin or a custom module, should be loaded through the
							Element:a
								Include
								extension. Prior to 6.3.x, module definitions could be added by creating the file
							Element:code
								./include/modules_override.php
								. This method of creating module definitions is still compatible but is not recommended from a best practices standpoint.

										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											$moduleList
											is an array containing a list of modules in the system. The format of the array is to have a numeric index and a value of the modules unique key.
									Node:

										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											$beanList
											variable is an array that stores a list of all active beans (modules) in the application. The format of the array is
										Element:code
											array('<bean plural name>' => '<bean singular name>');
											. The
										Element:code
											key is used to lookup values in the
										Element:span
											$beanList
										Element:code
											$beanFiles
											variable.

										Element:span
											$beanFiles
										Element:code
											array('<bean singular name>' => '<relative class file>');
											. The bean name, stored in singular form, is a reference to the class name of the object, which is looked up from the $beanList 'key'.
