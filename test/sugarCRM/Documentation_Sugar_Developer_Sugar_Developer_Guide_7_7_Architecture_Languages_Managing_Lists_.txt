								Overview

								There are three ways to manage lists in Sugar: by using Studio in the application, by directly modifying the list's language strings, and via the code-level Dropdown Helper. This page explains all three methods.

								Managing Lists With Studio
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you know the name of the list you would like to edit, you can access the application's dropdown editor by navigating to Admin > Dropdown Editor. Alternatively, navigate to a field that uses the list (Admin > Studio > {Module} > Fields > {field_name}) and click "Edit" under the Dropdown List field:
							Element:br
							Element:img
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For information on using the dropdown editor, please refer to the
							Element:a
								Developer Tools
								documentation in the Administration Guide.

								Directly Modifying Lists
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								There are two ways to directly modify the language strings. The first way is to modify the custom language file, located at
							Element:code
								./custom/include/language/<language key>.lang.php
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you are developing a customization to be distributed and you want to be able to create new or override existing list values, you will need to work within the extension application directory. To do this you will create the following file:
							Element:code
								./custom/Extension/application/Ext/Language/<language key>.<unique name>.php
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The file will contain your override values. Please note that within this file you will set each label index individually. An example of this is:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								<?php $app_list_strings['LIST_NAME']['Key_Value'] = 'My Display Value';
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once the file is created with your adjustments, navigate to Admin > Repair > Quick Rebuild & Repair. This will compile all of the Extension files from
							Element:code
								./custom/Extension/application/Ext/Language/
								to
							Element:code
								./custom/application/Ext/Language/<language key>.lang.ext.php
								.

								Managing Lists With Dropdown Helper
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can use the dropdown helper to manage lists at the code level. This example demonstrates how to add and update values for a specific dropdown list:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								require_once('modules/Studio/DropDowns/DropDownHelper.php'); $dropdownHelper = new DropDownHelper(); $parameters = array(); $parameters['dropdown_name'] = 'example_list'; $listValues = array( 'Key_Value_1' => 'Display Value 1', 'Key_Value_2' => 'Display Value 2', 'Key_Value_3' => 'Display Value 3' ); $count = 0; foreach ($listValues as $key=>$value) { $parameters['slot_'. $count] = $count; $parameters['key_'. $count] = $key; $parameters['value_'. $count] = $value; //set 'use_push' to true to update/add values while keeping old values $parameters['use_push'] = true; $count++; } $dropdownHelper->saveDropDown($parameters);
