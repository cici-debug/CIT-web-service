								SugarAutoLoader
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The SugarAutoLoader class, located in
							Element:code
								./include/utils/autoloader.php
								, keeps a map of files within the Sugar directory that may be loaded. The generated file map is located in the cache directory as
							Element:code
								./cache/file_map.php
								. If this file is manually deleted, it will be automatically rebuilt.

								Initializing the AutoLoader
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The
							Element:code
								init()
								function will Initialize the loader, register
							Element:code
								autoload()
								as an autoloader function, and load the bean map, file map, and extension map. This function is called at the beginning of an entryPoint.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								require_once('include/utils/autoloader.php'); SugarAutoloader::init();

								Rebuilding the File Map
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The autoloader rebuilds the map during a Quick Repair and Rebuilds (Admin > Repair > Quick Repair and Rebuild), module installs, and can rebuild at any time programmatically using the
							Element:code
								buildCache()
								function. Same other functions, such as
							Element:code
								write_array_to_file()
								, will automatically update the file map. If your code is writing custom files, it is strongly recommended to update the file map, however, be aware that this will update the metadata hash and force a reload for users. You should also note that, if you are hosting your instance on Sugar On-Demand, you are subject to the
							Element:a
								Module Loader Restrictions
								.

											The buildCache Function
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To programmatically rebuild the file map, you can use the function as shown below:
									Node:

										Element:pre
										Element:code
