								Requirements
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								A few requirements must be met before an instance can be migrated to the SugarCRM On-Demand environment:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
								The On-Site deployment must be running MySQL. If you are using SQL Server or Oracle, you will need to speak with your Sugar Customer Advocate about data migration options.
							Element:li
								The instance must be updated to a supported version of Sugar. To find out if your current version is supported you can check our
							Element:a
								Supported Versions
								. Please refer to the appropriate Administrator/Upgrade Guide for your version of SugarCRM if you need to upgrade your instance (
							Element:a
								http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation
								)

									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The version of your instance can be found by navigating to the About page in your SugarCRM instance from the global links menu. Once identified you can check this version against our
										Element:a
											.

											Support Portal
									Node:

										Element:p
											Inform SugarCRM Customer Support of your intention to migrate by opening a case through the support portal (
										Element:a
											http://www.sugarcrm.com/support/portal
											). They will provide you with an FTP site and a set of credentials so you can transfer your instance. SugarCRM Customer Support will expect you to provide two files. One file will be an archive (zip, tar, etc.) containing all the files and folders of your SugarCRM instance. The second file will be an export of your SQL database; it is a good idea to archive the resulting SQL export as well.

											Files and Folders
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You should be aware of the location of your SugarCRM instance on your On-Site server. If you do not, you can locate the path to your instance by navigating to:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											Admin > Schedulers
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Once there, you should see something similar to this:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tbody
										Element:tr
										Element:th
											To Setup Crontab
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											Note: In order to run Sugar Schedulers, add the following line to the crontab file:
										Element:br
										Element:strong
											* * * * * cd
										Element:span
											; php -f cron.php > /dev/null 2>&1
										Element:em
											<path to sugar instance>
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Now that you have located your SugarCRM instance, archive the entire contents of the SugarCRM root directory using the archive utility of your choice (zip, tar, WinZip, WinRar, 7zip, etc.). The SugarCRM root directory is the directory that contains the files "config.php", "cron.php", "sugarcrm.log" and the folders "custom", "cache", "modules" among others.

											Database
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The following describes how to export a MySQL database using the command line utility "mysqldump". If you prefer you may choose to use a tool such as phpMyAdmin to export your database. The command to export a MySQL database is:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											mysqldump -h localhost -u [MySQL user, e.g. root] -p[database password] [name of the database] > backup.sql
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you do not know the host, username, password, or database name you may refer to the "config.php" file of your SugarCRM instance. The "dbconfig" array in the "config.php" file contains all the required information. The example above showed the following "dbconfig" array:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											'dbconfig' => array ( 'db_host_name' => 'localhost', 'db_host_instance' => 'SQLEXPRESS', 'db_user_name' => 'sugarcrm', 'db_password' => 'MyP@ssword', 'db_name' => 'sugarcrm', 'db_type' => 'mysql', ),
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Using this information we can rewrite the command:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											mysqldump -h localhost -u sugarcrm -pMyP@ssword sugarcrm > backup.sql
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:h3
											Upload
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Finally, upload the two files to the FTP site provided by the SugarCRM Customer Support team. The instance will be deployed to the SugarCRM On-Demand environment and a URL to the instance will be provided to you.
