								Overview
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								As of Sugar® 7.5, the Composer dependency management integration has been made publicly available for Sugar developers. Because Composer is the de facto standard for managing PHP dependencies, this enhancement to the Sugar platform will make customizations based on external libraries more intuitive.

								Prerequisites
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								The Composer package must be available on your system if you wish to make any changes to the dependencies. Please refer to the
							Element:a
								Getting Started
								guide on Composer's website for more details on installation and usage.
							Element:li
								Composer is a command-line tool, so you must have access to the command-line interface on the system.
							Element:li
								You must have the proper file-system permissions to alter files in the Sugar instance directory.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:b
								Note:
								Before customizing the Composer configuration, be sure to read the documentation on this page in its entirety and feel confident in your knowledge of Composer. We strongly recommend reviewing the
							Element:a
								Composer website's documentation
								for more information.

											Finding Packages
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Packages that are available to Composer are published through
										Element:a
											Packagist
											. This is the primary place to look for third-party libraries. Composer is not restricted to packages published on Packagist, so you may refer to public or private repositories that are not found on Packagist. For more information, please refer to the
										Element:a
											Repositories
											section of Composer's documentation.

										Element:h3
											Adding a New Package
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To add a new package, you must modify the "require" element and then update the dependencies. To learn more about Composer's "require" element, please refer to the
										Element:a
											Composer documentation
											. For information on version constraints, please refer to Composer's
										Element:a
											package versions
											documentation.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Follow these steps to add a new package:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ol
										Element:li
											Back up the files
										Element:code
											./composer.json
											and
										Element:code
											./composer.lock
											.
										Element:li
											Modify the "require" section for
										Element:code
											./composer.json
											. For example, to add the
										Element:code
											monolog/monolog
											package to
										Element:code
											./composer.json
											, add the package name and the required version constraint in the "require" section, as shown here:
										Element:br
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											{ "name": "sugarcrm/sugarcrm", ... "require": { "monolog/monolog": "~1.11", "ruflin/elastica": "v1.2.1.0", "php": ">=5.3.0" }, "require-dev": { "phpunit/phpunit": "4.1.4" }, ... }
										Element:li
											Next, update the dependencies. The easiest way to do this is by running
										Element:code
											composer update --no-dev
											from the directory where
										Element:code
											composer.json
											lives. This is the recommended method for production systems.
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											Composer will automatically determine which packages need to be fetched and updated.
										Element:li
											All dependencies are stored in the
										Element:code
											./vendor/
											folder.
										Element:li
											The
										Element:code
											./composer.lock
											file is updated with the installed versions and repository information.
										Element:li
											The
										Element:code
											--no-dev
											switch skips the packages in the
										Element:code
											require-dev
											section because those packages are only needed for development.
										Element:li
											Using the example in step 2, you will see the Monolog package has a dependency of its own: the
										Element:code
											psr/log
											package. Composer automatically installed this dependency.
										Element:li
											Clear the cache used by Sugar's autoloader to be sure the newly installed dependencies are available. Manually remove these two files:
										Element:ul
										Element:li
										Element:code
											./cache/file_map.php
										Element:li
										Element:code
											./cache/class_map.php
										Element:p
											Alternatively, when developing new code in Sugar, you could enable Developer Mode in Sugar. When enabled, the autoloader will automatically refresh itself.

											Integrations
									Node:

											When updating the Composer configuration, Composer will generate different mappings based on the settings of every dependency:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											Class map
										Element:li
											PSR-0 map
										Element:li
											PSR-4 map
										Element:li
											Include paths (deprecated)
									Node:

											Internals
									Node:

										Element:p
											To prevent endless file stats, Sugar's autoloader maintains a full list of all files at its disposal. This list is only generated once and is maintained in
										Element:code
											./cache/file_map.php
											. Most of the Sugar codebase uses the autoloader to determine whether a file is available rather than performing expensive
										Element:code
											file_exists
											calls.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											A second file, stored in
										Element:code
											./cache/class_map.php
											, maintains a flat list of class-name-to-file mappings. When you make any changes to the file system, clear both files before testing new code.

											Optimization
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When updating dependencies through Composer, it is advised that the production system uses the optimize flag:
										Element:code
											composer update --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
											". By doing so, Composer will scan all files in the packages it manages and create a full list of PSR-0 and PSR-4 class name to file mappings, instead of performing this lookup on the fly by the autoloader itself on runtime.

											Developer Mode
									Node:

										Element:p
											When Developer Mode is enabled, the autoloader will bypass any persistent setting from both
										Element:code
											file_map
											or
										Element:code
											class_map
											. Adding new files or updating dependencies will be directly picked up by the autoloader without performing a Quick Repair and Rebuild.

						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Is the composer package required to install a Sugar instance?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								No. The Sugar installer ships with all required code bundled together. The installer process does not execute any Composer commands. The installer will deploy both
							Element:code
								composer.json
								and
							Element:code
								composer.lock
								in the web root directory as a reference of all dependencies which are controlled by Composer.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:b
								Why does Sugar ship
							Element:code
								./composer.json
								and
							Element:code
								./composer.lock
								if the installer doesn't rely on them?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Composer is used internally during development to manage Sugar's dependencies on third-party libraries and packages. The Composer files are shipped during development to manage Sugar's dependencies on third-party libraries and packages. The composer files are shipped with the product to give our customers the ability to expand from them.
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:b
								Is the Composer package required to upgrade a Sugar instance?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								No. The Sugar upgrader ships, just like the installer, with all required code bundled together. The upgrade process will validate the present Composer configuration and verify if it is compatible with the upgrade. In the case of a custom configuration, the upgrade process will report any issues which need to be resolved by the system administrator before the upgrade can proceed.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:b
								Why are there no wildcards in the version constraints? Doesn't composer.lock keep track of exact version numbers?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The lock file is designed to lock the dependencies to a specific version, but to protect our customers from unintentionally pulling in newer versions of dependencies owned by SugarCRM, we have chosen to use explicit version numbers in the composer.json file too.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:b
								May I change the version number of a package?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You cannot change version numbers for packages added by Sugar. Sugar will always configure exact version numbers for all of its dependencies. Changing these version numbers will result in an unsupported platform. The version constraints of packages not owned by Sugar may be modified at the developer's discretion.
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:b
								Can I use Composer's autoloader?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								We strongly recommend against using Composer's autoloader. The Sugar autoloader is fully compatible with the
							Element:a
								PSR-0
								and
							Element:a
								PSR-4
								autoloading recommendations from PHP-FIG, which makes the registration of an additional autoloader like the one from Composer redundant. Sugar's autoloader consumes the different mappings which are generated by Composer directly.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:b
								How can I optimize the autoloader?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Sugar ships with an optimized class map out of the box, which is pre-generated through Composer. This class map contains all different class to file mappings known to the dependencies managed by Composer. When customizing the Composer configuration, it is sufficient to run composer update --optimize-autoloader which will refresh the class map. SugarCRM's autoloader takes full advantage of this optimization.
