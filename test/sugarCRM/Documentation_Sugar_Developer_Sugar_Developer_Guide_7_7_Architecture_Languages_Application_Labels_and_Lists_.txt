								Sugar, which is fully internationalized and localizable, differentiates languages with unique language keys. These keys prefix the files that correspond with particular languages. For example, the default language for the application is English (US), which is represented by the language key en_us. Any file that contains data specific to the English (US) language begins with the characters en_us. Language label keys that are not recognized will default to the English (US) version.

											The
										Element:code
											$app_list_strings
											array contains the various dropdown lists for the system while
										Element:code
											$app_strings
											contains the system application labels. The initial set of definitions can be found in
										Element:code
											./include/language/<language key>.lang.php
											. As you work within the system and deploy modules and lists through Studio, any changes to these lists will be reflected in the language's extension directory:
										Element:code
											./custom/Extension/application/Ext/Language/<language key>.<list name>.php
											.

											Customizing Application Labels and Lists
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											If you are developing a customization and want to be able to create or edit existing label or list values, you will need to work within the extension application directory. To do this, create
										Element:code
											./custom/Extension/application/Ext/Language/<language key>.<unique name>.php
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The file should contain your override values with each label index set individually. An example of this is:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											<?php $app_strings['LBL_KEY'] = 'My Display Label'; $app_list_strings['LIST_NAME']['Key_Value'] = 'My Display Value';
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Once the file is created with your adjustments, navigate to Admin > Repair > Quick Rebuild & Repair. This will compile all of the Extension files from
										Element:code
											./custom/Extension/application/Ext/Language/
											to
										Element:code
											./custom/application/Ext/Language/<language key>.lang.ext.php
											.

											Retrieving Labels
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											There are two ways to retrieve a label. The first is to use the
										Element:code
											translate()
											function found in
										Element:code
											./include/utils.php
											. This function will retrieve the label for the current user's language and can also be used to retrieve labels from
										Element:code
											$mod_strings
											,
										Element:code
											$app_strings
											, or
										Element:code
											app_list_strings
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											An example of this is:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											require_once('include/utils.php'); $label = translate('LBL_KEY');
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Alternatively, you can also use the global variable
										Element:code
											$app_strings
											as follows:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											global $app_strings; $label = ''; if (isset($app_strings['LBL_KEY'])) { $label = $app_strings['LBL_KEY']; }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											Note:
											If a label key is not found for the user's preferred language, the system will default to "en_us" and pull the English (US) version of the label for display.

											Note:
