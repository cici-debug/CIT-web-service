								Removing the Requirement in Configuration
						Node:

							Element:p
								By default, Sugar requires the accounts field to be populated on several modules. These modules include
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Opportunities
							Element:li
								Contacts
							Element:li
								Cases
							Element:li
								Contracts
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In order to remove this dependency, you will need to modify the
							Element:code
								require_accounts
								configuration in your
							Element:code
								./config_override.php
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								$sugar_config['require_accounts'] = false;
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The resulting file should look similar to:
							Element:br

								Removing the Requirement in View Metadata
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once you have updated your configuration, you may find the field is still required. This may be due to the views metadata having a the field's
							Element:code
								required
								attribute set to true. This will also need to be updated. Using the Opportunities record view as an example, we will need to do the following:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Edit
							Element:code
								./custom/modules/Opportunities/clients/base/views/record/record.php
								with a text editor application.
							Element:br
							Element:strong
								Note:
								If the path does not exist, you edit the Opportunities record view in Studio or you can duplicate
							Element:code
								./modules/Opportunities/clients/base/views/record/record.php
								to
							Element:code
								./custom
								.
							Element:strong
								/
								modules/Opportunities/clients/base/views/record/record.php
							Element:li
								Search for the
							Element:code
								account_name
								field in panel definitions of your record view.
							Element:li
								Remove
							Element:code
								'required' => true,
								from the
							Element:code
								account_name
								definition. If it doesn't already exist, you don't need to modify anything.
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								... 'fields' => array ( 0 => array ( 'name' => 'account_name', 'required' => false, ...
							Element:p
								Your resulting file should be:
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								... 'fields' => array ( 0 => array ( 'name' => 'account_name', ...
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:p
								These changes will only affect the record view for Opportunities. You may need to modify additional module layouts based on your use case. A list of other views you many need to modify for your module are shown below.
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								./custom/modules/<module>/clients/base/views/list/list.php
							Element:li
								./custom/modules/<module>/clients/base/views/record/record.php
							Element:li
								./custom/modules/<module>/clients/base/views/dupecheck-list/dupecheck-list.php
							Element:li
								./custom/modules/<module>/clients/base/views/resolve-conflicts-list/resolve-conflicts-list.php
							Element:li
								./custom/modules/<module>/clients/base/views/selection-list/selection-list.php
							Element:li
								./custom/modules/<module>/clients/base/views/subpanel-list/subpanel-list.php

								Once completed, you will need to navigate to Admin > Repairs and run a Quick Repair & Rebuild

								Application
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Now that the appropriate changes have been made, navigate to the Opportunities module and create a new opportunity record. You will notice that the Account Name field no longer indicates "Required" in the field. In addition, the Account Name field will no longer be marked as required when importing records into the Opportunities module.
