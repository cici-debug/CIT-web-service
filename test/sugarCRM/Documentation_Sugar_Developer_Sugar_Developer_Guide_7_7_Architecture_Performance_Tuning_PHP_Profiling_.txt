								As of the 6.6.2 release, Sugar introduced the ability to profile via
							Element:a
								XHProf
								, which is an easy-to-use, hierarchical profiler for PHP. This allows developers to better manage and understand customer performance issues introduced by their customizations. This tool enables quick and accurate identification of the sources of performance sinks within the code by generating profiling logs. Profiling gives you the ability to see the call stack for the entire page load with timing details around function and method calls as well as statistics on call frequency.

							Element:p
								Assuming XHProf is installed and enabled in your PHP configuration (which you can learn how to do in the
							Element:a
								PHP Manual
								), you can enable profiling in Sugar by adding the following parameters to the
							Element:code
								./config_override.php
								file:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								$sugar_config['xhprof_config']['enable'] = true; $sugar_config['xhprof_config']['log_to'] = '{instance server path}/cache/xhprof'; // x where x is a number and 1/x requests are profiled. So to sample all requests set it to 1 $sugar_config['xhprof_config']['sample_rate'] = 1; // array of function names to ignore from the profile (pass into xhprof_enable) $sugar_config['xhprof_config']['ignored_functions'] = array(); // flags for xhprof $sugar_config['xhprof_config']['flags'] = XHPROF_FLAGS_CPU + XHPROF_FLAGS_MEMORY;

							Element:p
								Please note that with the above 'log_to' parameter, you would need to create the
							Element:code
								./cache/xhprof/
								directory in your instance directory with proper permissions and ownership for the Apache user. You can also opt to leave the
							Element:code
								xhprof_config.log_to
								parameter empty and set the logging path via the
							Element:code
								xhprof.output_dir
								parameter in the
							Element:code
								php.ini
								file.
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								Once the above parameters are set, XHProf profiling will log all output to the indicated directory and allow you to research any performance related issues encountered in the process of developing and maintaining the application.
