								Instantiating a DB Object
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To use the DB object, you should use the global database object:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								$GLOBALS['db']
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If you should need to manually instantiate the DB object, you can use the DBManagerFactory class's
							Element:code
								getInstance()
								method. This method will create a reference to the DB object for the instance.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								$db = DBManagerFactory::getInstance();

											Retrieving Results
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To query the database for a result set, use the
										Element:code
											query()
											and
										Element:code
											fetchByAssoc()
											methods. The
										Element:code
											query()
											method will retrieve the results while the
										Element:code
											fetchByAssoc()
											method will iterate through the results:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											$sql = "SELECT id FROM accounts WHERE deleted = 0"; $result = $GLOBALS['db']->query($sql); while($row = $GLOBALS['db']->fetchByAssoc($result) ) { //Use $row['id'] to grab the id fields value $id = $row['id']; }

										Element:h3
											Retrieving a Single Result
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To retrieve a single result from the database, such as a specific record field, you can use the
										Element:code
											getOne()
											method:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											$sql = "SELECT name FROM accounts WHERE id = '{$id}'"; $name = $GLOBALS['db']->getOne($sql);

											Limiting Results
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To limit the results of a query, you can add a limit to the SQL string or use the
										Element:code
											limitQuery()
											method:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											$sql = "SELECT id FROM accounts WHERE deleted = 0"; $offset = 0; $limit = 1; $result = $GLOBALS['db']->limitQuery($sql, $offset, $limit); while($row = $GLOBALS['db']->fetchByAssoc($result) ) { //Use $row['id'] to grab the id fields value $id = $row['id']; }​

								Generating SQL Queries
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								To have Sugar automatically generate SQL queries, you can use the following methods from the bean class.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:h3
											Select Queries
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To create a select query you can use the
										Element:code
											create_new_list_query()
											method:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											$bean = BeanFactory::newBean($module); $order_by = ''; $where = ''; $fields = array( 'id', 'name', ); $sql = $bean->create_new_list_query($order_by, $where, $fields);
						Node:

										Element:h3
											Count Queries
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You can also run the generated SQL through the
										Element:code
											create_list_count_query()
											method to generate a count query:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											$bean = BeanFactory::newBean('Accounts'); $sql = "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE deleted = 0"; $count_sql = $bean->create_list_count_query($sql);
