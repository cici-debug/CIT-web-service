								Relationships are initially defined in the module's vardefs file under the relationships array. For reference, you can find them using the vardef path as follows:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								./modules/<module>/vardefs.php

								Database Structure
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								In Sugar, most relationships are stored using a joining table. This applies to both one-to-many (1:M) relationships as well as many-to-many (M:M) relationships. An example of this is the relationship between Accounts and Cases where there are three tables: accounts, accounts_cases, and cases. You will find that the joining table, accounts_cases, will contain the fields needed in order to establish the relationship link.
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								The fields on the accounts_cases table are listed below:

								Relationship Cache
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								All relationships in Sugar are compiled into the cache directory:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								./cache/Relationships/relationships.cache.php
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If needed, the relationships cache can be rebuilt by navigating to Admin > Repair > Rebuild Relationships. Alternatively, a list of all the relationships can also be found in the relationships table:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								SELECT * FROM relationships WHERE deleted = 0;
