					Creating Custom Entry Points

								Overview

								As of 6.3.x, entry points can be created using the extension framework. The entry point extension directory, located at
							Element:code
								./custom/Extension/application/Ext/EntryPointRegistry/
								, is compiled into
							Element:code
								./custom/application/Ext/EntryPointRegistry/entry_point_registry.ext.php
								after a Quick Repair and Rebuild. Additional information can be found in the extensions
							Element:a
								EntryPointRegistry
								section.

								Custom Entry Points
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Prior to 6.3.x, an entry point could be added by creating the file
							Element:code
								./custom/include/MVC/Controller/entry_point_registry.php
								. This method of creating entry points is still compatible but is not recommended from a best practices standpoint as duplicating
							Element:code
								./include/MVC/Controller/entry_point_registry.php
								to
							Element:code
								./custom/include/MVC/Controller/entry_point_registry.php
								will prevent any upgrader updates to
							Element:code
								./include/MVC/Controller/entry_point_registry.php
								from being reflected in the system. Entry point registries contain two properties:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								file
								- The path to the entry point.
							Element:li
							Element:strong
								auth
								- A Boolean value that determines whether or not the user must be authenticated in order to access the entry point.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								$entry_point_registry['customEntryPoint'] = array( 'file' => 'path/to/customEntryPoint.php', 'auth' => true );

								Example
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The first step is to create the actual entry point. This is where all of the logic for your entry point will be located. This file can be located anywhere you choose. For my example, I will create:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								./custom/customEntryPoint.php
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								<?php if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point'); echo "Hello World!";
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Next, we will need to create our extension in the application extensions. This will be located at:
							Element:br
								./custom/Extension/application/Ext/EntryPointRegistry/customEntryPoint.php
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								<?php $entry_point_registry['customEntryPoint'] = array( 'file' => 'custom/customEntryPoint.php', 'auth' => true );
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Finally, navigate to Admin > Repair > Quick Repair and Rebuild. The system will then generate the file
							Element:code
								./custom/application/Ext/EntryPointRegistry/entry_point_registry.ext.php
								containing your registry entry. We are now able to access our entry point by navigating to:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								http://{sugar url}/index.php?entryPoint=customEntryPoint
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
