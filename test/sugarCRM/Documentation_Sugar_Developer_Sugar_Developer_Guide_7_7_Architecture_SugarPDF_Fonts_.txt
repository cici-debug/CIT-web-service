								Font Cache
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The font list is built by the font manager with the listFontFiles() or getSelectFontList() methods. The list is then saved in the cache as ./cache/Sugarpdf/cachedFontList.php. This caching process prevents unnecessary parsing of the fonts folder. The font cache is automatically cleared when the delete() or add() methods are used. When you create a Font loadable module you will have to call the clearCachedFile() method in a post_execute and post_uninstall action in the manifest.php to clear the font cache.
