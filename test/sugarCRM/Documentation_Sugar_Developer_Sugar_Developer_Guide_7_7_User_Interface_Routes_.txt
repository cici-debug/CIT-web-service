								Routes
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Routes, defined in
							Element:code
								./include/javascript/sugar7.js
								, are URL patterns signified by a hashtag ("#") in the URL. An example module URL pattern for the Sugar application is
							Element:code
								http://{site url}/#<module>
								. This route would direct a user to the list view for a given module. The following sections will outline routes and how they are defined.

											Route Definitions
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The router accepts route definitions in the following format:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											routes = [ { name: "My First Route", route: "pattern/to/match", callback: function() { //handling logic here. } }, { name: "My Second Route", route: "pattern/:variable", callback: "<callback name>" } ]
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:span
											A route takes in three properties: the name of the route, the route pattern to match, and the callback to be called when the route is matched. If a default callback is desired, you can specify the callback name as a string.

											Route Patterns
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Route patterns determine where to direct the user. An example of routing is done when navigating to an account record. When doing this you may notice that your URL is:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											http://{site url}/#Accounts/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											A stock route's definition is defined in
										Element:code
											./include/javascript/sugar7.js
											as:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											{ name: "record", route: ":module/:id" },
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Variables in the route pattern are prefixed with a colon such as
										Element:code
											:variable
											. The route pattern above contains two variables:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											module
										Element:li
											id

								Custom Routes
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								As of Sugar 7.5.x, you can add custom routes by including a JavaScript file in the system and registering a new route after the router has been started. The Sidecar router has a
							Element:code
								router:start
								event that can be used to trigger registration of custom routes for the application to utilize. The following example code shows how to use this event to register a new route in Sugar:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								app.events.on("router:start", function(){ //Register the route #test/123 app.router.route("test/:id", "test123", function() { console.log(arguments); app.controller.loadView({ layout: "custom_layout", create: true }); }); })
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The above code would register the new route
							Element:code
								#test/<id>
								in the SugarCRM system, and if you navigated to that URL fragment, it would log the arguments to the browser console, and then attempt to load a custom view added to the system. To add a custom route to Sugar, you can use the
							Element:a
								JSGroupings
								.
