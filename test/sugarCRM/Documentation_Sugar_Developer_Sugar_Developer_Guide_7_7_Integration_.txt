								Posting Data To Sugar
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When integrating with Sugar, it is best to avoid long-running web requests. While performance-draining requests are not always obvious, once an issue has been identified, it is best to move the processing to the backend.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								By default, we expect a post to an endpoint such as
							Element:code
								rest/v10/Accounts
								to be straightforward, however, adding Workflows, Logic Hooks, and Sugar Logic may stress the otherwise simple process and cause issues with webheads and other resources being used in the process.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								An example of such a request is shown here:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								curl -v -H "oauth-token: 4afd4aea-df99-7cec-4d94-560a97cda9f8" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"name": "Example Account"}' http://<site_url>/rest/v10/Accounts
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								If this (or a similar) request is identified as the process delaying the system, remedy the situation using one of the approaches in the sections below.

											Queuing Data in the Job Queue
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											One solution is to send the data to the Job Queue to be processed by the cron during one of its cycles. To accomplish this, make a file customization to add to the
										Element:code
											target
											processing function. For this article's use case, create
										Element:code
											./custom/Extension/modules/Schedulers/Ext/ScheduledTasks/CustomCreateAccountJob.php
											and send any stored data to it for processing. Enter the following code in the php file:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											<?php function CustomCreateAccountJob($job) { if (!empty($job->data)) { $account = BeanFactory::newBean('Accounts');
										Element:span
											$fields
										Element:span
											=
										Element:span
											json_decode
											($job->data,
										Element:span
											true
											); foreach($fields as $field => $value) { $account->$field = $value; } $account->save(); if (!empty($account->id)) { return true; } } return false; }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Next, modify the request to pass the new account data to the SchedulerJobs module in the
										Element:code
											data
											field and specify the new function in the
										Element:code
											target
											field, as follows:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											curl -v -H "oauth-token: 4afd4aea-df99-7cec-4d94-560a97cda9f8" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"assigned_user_id": "1", "name":"Queue Create Account", "status":"queued", "data":"{\"name\": \"Example Account\"}", "target":"function::CustomCreateAccountJob"}' http://<site_url>rest/v10/SchedulersJobs
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											This solution will queue data for processing and free up system resources to send more requests. For more information, please refer to the
										Element:a
											Scheduler Jobs
											documentation.
