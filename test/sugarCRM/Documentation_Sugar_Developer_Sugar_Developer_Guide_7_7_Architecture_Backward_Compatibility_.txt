								Overview

								As of Sugar® 7, modules are built using the Sidecar framework as the MVC architecture is being deprecated. Modules that have not yet been moved over to the Sidecar framework are set in what Sugar refers to as "backward compatibility" (BWC) mode.
						Node:

							Element:p
								Currently, the Studio-enabled modules in backward compatibility are:

								URL Differences
						Node:

							Element:p
								There are some important differences between the legacy MVC and Sidecar URLs. When a module is set in backward compatibility, the URL will contain "/#bwc/" in the path and use query string parameters to identify the module and action. An example of the Sidecar BWC URL is shown below.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								http://{site url}/#bwc/index.php?module=<module>&action=<action>
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You can see that this differs from the standard route of:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								http://{site url}/#<module>/<record id>

								Studio Differences
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								There are some important differences between the legacy MVC modules and Sidecar modules. When a module is in backward compatibility mode, an asterisk is placed next to the modules name in studio. Modules in backward compatibility will use the legacy MVC metadata layouts, located in ./modules/<module>/metadata/, as follows:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Layouts
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Edit View
							Element:li
								Detail View
							Element:li
								List View
							Element:li
								Search
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Basic Search
							Element:li
								Advanced Search
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								These layouts differ from Sidecar in many ways. The underlying metadata is very different and you should notice that the MVC layouts have a separation between the EditView and DetailView whereas the Sidercar layouts make use of the Record View. The Sidecar metadata for Sugar is located in ./modules/<module>/clients/base/views/.
