								Overview
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The extension framework, defined in
							Element:code
								./ModuleInstall/extensions.php
								, provides the capability to modify Sugar metadata such as
							Element:a
								vardefs
								and
							Element:a
								layouts
								in a safe way that supports installing, uninstalling, enabling, and disabling without interfering with other customizations.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Application extensions are stored under
							Element:code
								./custom/Extension/application/Ext/
								and module extensions are under
							Element:code
								./custom/Extension/modules/<module>/Ext/
								. The files in these directories are aggregated into a single file with a predefined name for the system to use. An example of this is the vardefs extension. The vardef extension directory for Accounts is located in
							Element:code
								./custom/Extension/modules/Accounts/Ext/Vardefs/
								. When a module is installed, uninstalled, enabled, or disabled, the files contained in this directory are merged into
							Element:code
								./custom/modules/Accounts/Ext/Vardefs/vardefs.ext.php
								. A Quick Repair & Rebuild will also cause the files to merge.
						Node:

								The core extension mappings are listed in the Topics section at the bottom of this page.
