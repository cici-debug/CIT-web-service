								The following article describes the process of migrating a potentially broken instance to a clean install.

								This is beneficial in the use case of corrupted core files. This will not correct issues caused by broken customizations.

								To migrate your instance to a clean install you will need to do the following:
							Element:br
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
								Have full permissions to modify the system files.
							Element:li
								Identify your Sugar version. The version of your instance can be found by navigating to the About page in your SugarCRM instance from the global links menu.
							Element:br
							Element:li
								Once you have identified your Sugar version, you will need to download the full installer package of your Sugar version from the
							Element:a
								Support Portal
								. If you are on 7.2.0 Pro, you must download the SugarPro-7.2.0.zip package or this migration will not work.

								Migrating to a New Instance

							Element:ol
							Element:li
								Make a complete backup of your broken instance. This includes both the filesystem and database.
							Element:li
								Extract the contents of your downloaded Sugar package ( Sugar<Edition>-<Version>.zip ) to your web directory. This will be your clean Sugar directory that we will migrate your existing instance to.
							Element:li
								You will then need to copy the following directories and files from your broken instance to the clean instance:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								./config.php
							Element:li
								./config_override.php - If it exists.
							Element:li
								./custom/
							Element:li
								./uploads/
							Element:li
								./cache/images/ - This is optional and contains the embedded emails displayed in the UI.
							Element:li
								If you are on a version prior to 6.4.0, you will also need to copy over the entire ./cache/ directory.
							Element:li
								Next you will need to identify if you have any custom modules. These folders will reside in your ./modules/ directory and have a naming format of <key>_<module name>. You will need to copy these files to their corresponding directory in the clean instance you extracted in step 2.
							Element:li
								Once the files have been moved to the clean instance, you can remove your old instances files and move the clean instance in its place. If you choose to move the instance to a new location on the server, you will need to update the
							Element:code
								$sugar_config['site_url']
								parameter in your config.php and/or config_override.php files.
							Element:li
								Reset your filesystem permissions.
							Element:li
								Log into your instance as an administrator and navigate to Admin > Repair > Quick Repair and Rebuild.
