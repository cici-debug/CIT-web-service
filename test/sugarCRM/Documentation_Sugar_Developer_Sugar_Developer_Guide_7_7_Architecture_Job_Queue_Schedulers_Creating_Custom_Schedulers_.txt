								In addition to the default schedulers that are packaged with Sugar, developers can create custom scheduler jobs.

								Defining the Job Label
						Node:

						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The first step to create a custom scheduler is creating a label extension file. This will add the display text for the scheduler job when creating a new scheduler in Admin > Scheduler. The file path of our file will be in the format of
							Element:code
								./custom/Extension/modules/Schedulers/Ext/Language/<language key>.<name>.php
								. For our example, name the file
							Element:code
								en_us.custom_job.php
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								./custom/Extension/modules/Schedulers/Ext/Language/en_us.custom_job.php
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								<?php $mod_strings['LBL_CUSTOM_JOB'] = 'Custom Job';

								Defining the Job Function
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Next, define the custom job's function using the extension framework. The file path of the file will be in the format of
							Element:code
								./custom/Extension/modules/Schedulers/Ext/ScheduledTasks/<function_name>.php
								. For this example, name the file
							Element:code
								custom_job.php
								. Prior to 6.3.x, job functions were added by creating the file
							Element:code
								./custom/modules/Schedulers/_AddJobsHere.php
								. This method of creating functions is still compatible but is not recommended from a best practices standpoint.

						(type) c

							Element:p
								./custom/Extension/modules/Schedulers/Ext/ScheduledTasks/custom_job.php
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								<?php array_push($job_strings, 'custom_job'); function custom_job() { //logic here //return true for completed return true; }

								Using the New Job
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once the files are in place, navigate to Admin > Repair > Quick Repair and Rebuild. This will rebuild the extension directories with our additions. Next, navigate to Admin > Scheduler > Create Scheduler. In the Jobs dropdown, there will be a new custom job in the list.
