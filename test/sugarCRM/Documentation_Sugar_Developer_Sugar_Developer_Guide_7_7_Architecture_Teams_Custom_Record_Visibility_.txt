								Overview
						Node:

							Element:p
								The visibility framework provides the capability to alter the queries Sugar uses to retrieve records from the database. This framework can allow for additional restrictions or specific logic to meet business requirements of hiding or showing only specific records. Visibility classes only apply to certain aspects of Sugar record retrieval, e.g. List Views, Dashlets, and Filter Lookups.

								Custom Row Visibility
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Custom visibility class files are stored under
							Element:code
								./custom/data/visibility/
								. The files in this directory can be enabled or disabled by modifying a module's visibility property located in
							Element:code
								./custom/Extension/modules/<module>/Ext/Vardefs/
								. Every enabled visibility class is merged into the module's definition, allowing multiple layers of logic to be added to a module.

											Visibility Class
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To add custom row visibility, you must create a visibility class that will extend the core SugarVisibility class
										Element:code
											./data/SugarVisibility.php
											. The visibility class has the ability to override the following methods:
									Node:
									(type) c

												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:h4
														Pre 7.7.1.0
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Prior to 7.7.1.0, developers only needed to focus on the following methods.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:table
													Element:tbody
													Element:tr
													Element:td
													Element:strong
														Name
													Element:td
													Element:strong
														Description
													Element:tr
													Element:td
														addVisibilityFrom
													Element:td
														Add visibility clauses to the FROM part of the query
													Element:tr
													Element:td
														addVisibilityFromQuery
													Element:td
														Add visibility clauses to the FROM part of SugarQuery
													Element:tr
													Element:td
														addVisibilityWhere
													Element:td
														Add visibility clauses to the WHERE part of the query
													Element:tr
													Element:td
														addVisibilityWhereQuery
													Element:td
														Add visibility clauses to the WHERE part of SugarQuery

													Element:h4
														7.7.1.0+
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														As of 7.7.1.0, several methods have been deprecated and we have implemented a new
													Element:code
														addVisibilityQuery()
														method.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:table
													Element:tbody
													Element:tr
													Element:td
													Element:strong
														Name
													Element:td
													Element:strong
														Description
													Element:tr
													Element:td
														addVisibilityQuery
													Element:td
														Add visibility clauses to a SugarQuery object.
													Element:tr
													Element:td
														addVisibilityFrom
													Element:td
														[Deprecated] Add visibility clauses to the FROM part of the query. This method should still be implemented, as not all objects have been switched over to use
													Element:code
														addVisibilityQuery()
														method.
													Element:tr
													Element:td
														addVisibilityFromQuery
													Element:td
														[Deprecated] Add visibility clauses to the FROM part of SugarQuery. This method should still be implemented, as not all objects have been switched over to use
													Element:code
														addVisibilityQuery()
														method.
													Element:tr
													Element:td
														addVisibilityWhere
													Element:td
														[Deprecated] Add visibility clauses to the WHERE part of the query. This method should still be implemented, as not all objects have been switched over to use
													Element:code

													Element:tr

													Element:td
														[Deprecated] Add visibility clauses to the WHERE part of SugarQuery. This method should still be implemented, as not all objects have been switched over to use
													Element:code

														method.

														Example
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The following example will create a new visibility class called 'filterAccounts_A1':
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														./custom/data/visibility/filterAccounts_A1.php
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														<?php if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point'); class filterAccounts_A1 extends SugarVisibility { public function addVisibilityWhere(&$query) { $table_alias = $this->getOption('table_alias'); if(empty( $table_alias)) { $table_alias = $this->bean->table_name; } $where_clause = "$table_alias.name like 'A1_%'"; if(!empty($query)) { $query .= " AND $where_clause"; } else { $query = $where_clause; } return $query; } public function addVisibilityWhereQuery(SugarQuery $sugarQuery, $options = array()) { $sugarQuery->where()->starts('name','A1_'); return $sugarQuery; } /** * For compatibility with 7.7.1.x+ instances the following code should also be implemented * For Pre-7.7.1.x instances, this function will never be used */ public function addVisibilityQuery(SugarQuery $sugarQuery) { $sugarQuery->where()->starts('name','A1_'); return $sugarQuery; } }
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														To enable this visibility class on the Accounts module, we need to create the following file:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														./custom/Extension/modules/Accounts/Ext/Vardefs/<file>.php
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														<?php $dictionary['Account']['visibility']['filterAccounts_A1'] = true;
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Finally, navigate to Admin > Repair > Quick Repair and Rebuild. The system will then enable the visibility class.
