							Element:p
								As of Sugar 7.0.0, you can easily define your own endpoint. All custom global endpoints will be located in the following directory:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								./custom/clients/<client>/api/
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								All custom endpoints specific to a module will be located in:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								./custom/modules/<module>/clients/<client>/api/
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Note:
								The Sugar application client type is "base". More information on the various client types can be found in the
							Element:a
								Clients
								section.

								Defining New Endpoints
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The endpoint class will be created in
							Element:code
								./custom/clients/<client>/api/
								and will extend SugarApi. Within this class, you will need to implement a
							Element:code
								registerApiRest()
								function that will define your endpoint paths.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								An example is shown below:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								./custom/clients/base/api/MyEndpointsApi.php
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								<?php if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point'); class MyEndpointsApi extends SugarApi { public function registerApiRest() { return array( //GET 'MyGetEndpoint' => array( //request type 'reqType' => 'GET', //set authentication 'noLoginRequired' => false, //endpoint path 'path' => array('MyEndpoint', 'GetExample', '?'), //endpoint variables 'pathVars' => array('', '', 'data'), //method to call 'method' => 'MyGetMethod', //short help string to be displayed in the help documentation 'shortHelp' => 'An example of a GET endpoint', //long help to be displayed in the help documentation 'longHelp' => 'custom/clients/base/api/help/MyEndPoint_MyGetEndPoint_help.html', ), ); } /** * Method to be used for my MyEndpoint/GetExample endpoint */ public function MyGetMethod($api, $args) { //custom logic return $args; } } ?>

											registerApiRest() Method
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Your extended class will contain two methods. The first method is
										Element:code
											registerApiRest()
											which will return an array that defines your REST endpoints. Each endpoint will need the following properties:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tbody
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											Name
										Element:td
											Type
										Element:td
											Description
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											reqType
										Element:td
											Array | String
										Element:td
											An array of one or many request types of the endpoint. Possible values are: GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											noLoginRequired
										Element:td
											Boolean
										Element:td
											Determines whether the endpoint is authenticated. Setting this value to true will remove the authentication requirement.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											path
										Element:td
											Array
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The endpoint path. An endpoint path of:
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											'path' => array('MyEndpoint', 'GetExample'),
										Element:p
											Will equate to the path of:
										Element:pre
											http://{site url}/rest/v10/MyEndpoint/GetExample
											To pass in a variable string to your endpoint, you will add a path of '?'. This will allow you to pass URL data to your selected method given that it is specified in the pathVars.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											pathVars
										Element:td
											Array
										Element:td
										Element:p
											The path variables. For each path on your endpoint, you can opt to pass its value in as a parameter to your selected method. An empty path variable will ignore the path.
										Element:p
											Example:
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											'path' => array('MyEndpoint', 'GetExample', '?'), ​'pathVars' => array('', '', 'data'),
										Element:p
											The above will pass in the following to your selected method as the $args parameter when calling http://{site url}/rest/v10/MyEndpoint/GetExample/MyData
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											stdClass Object ( [__sugar_url] => v10/MyEndpoint/GetExample/mydata [data] => MyData )
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											method
										Element:td
											String
										Element:td
											The method to pass the pathVars to. This can be named anything you choose and will be located in your SugarApi extended class.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											shortHelp
										Element:td
											String
										Element:td
											A short help string for developers when looking at the help documentation.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											longHelp
										Element:td
											String
										Element:td
											Path to a long help file. This file will be loaded when a user clicks an endpoint from the help documentation.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											minVersion
										Element:td
											Integer
										Element:td
											The minimum API Version this endpoint can be used with. See
										Element:a
											Scoring
											Section below.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											maxVersion
										Element:td
											Integer
										Element:td
											The maximum API Version this endpoint can be used with. See
										Element:a
											Scoring
											Section below.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											extraScore
										Element:td
											Integer
										Element:td
											Add an extra score value to the Scoring of this endpoint, to place priority on its usage. See
										Element:a
											Scoring
											Section bloew.

										Element:p
											The second method can be named anything you choose but it is important to note that it will need to match the name of the method you specified for your endpoint. This method will require the parameters
										Element:code
											$api
											and
										Element:code
											$args
											. The
										Element:code
											MyGetMethod()
											in the example above will be used when the endpoint
										Element:code
											MyEndpoint/GetExample
											is called. Any path variables, query string parameters or posted data will be available in the $args parameter for you to work with.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											public function $endpointMethod($api, $args) { //logic return $returnData; }

											The final step once you have your endpoint working is to document it. This file can reside anywhere in the system and will be referenced in your endpoints longHelp property. An example of the help documentation can be found below:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											custom/clients/base/api/help/MyEndPoint_MyGetEndPoint_help.html

								Redefining Existing Endpoints
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								With endpoints, you may have a need to extend an existing endpoint to meet your needs. When doing this it is important that you do not remove anything from the return array of the endpoint. Doing so could result in unexpected behavior due to other functionality using the same endpoint.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								For this example, we will extend the ping endpoint to return "Pong <timestamp>". To do this, we will need to extend the existing PingApi class and define our method overrides.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								./custom/clients/base/api/CustomPingApi.php
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								<?php if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point'); require_once("clients/base/api/PingApi.php"); class CustomPingApi extends PingApi { public function registerApiRest() { //in case we want to add additional endpoints return parent::registerApiRest(); } //override to modify the ping function of the ping endpoint public function ping($api, $args) { $result = parent::ping($api, $args); //append the current timestamp return $result . ' ' . time(); } }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								As you can see, we extended registerApiRest to fetch existing endpoint definitions in case we want to add our own. We then added an override for the ping method to return our new value. Once the file is in place you will need to navigate to Admin > Repair > Quick Repair and Rebuild. Once completed, any call made to
							Element:code
								<url>/rest/v10/ping
								will result in a response of "ping <timestamp>".

								Endpoint Scoring
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								When generating custom endpoints or overriding existing endpoints, the system can determine which endpoint to use based on the score placed on the registered endpoints. The scoring calculation works in the following manner for registered endpoints.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:table
							Element:tbody
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:strong
								Route Path
							Element:td
							Element:strong
								Score
							Element:tr
							Element:td
								?
							Element:td
								0.75
							Element:tr
							Element:td
								<module>
							Element:td
								1.0
							Element:tr
							Element:td
								Exact Match
							Element:td
								1.75
							Element:tr
							Element:td
								Custom
							Element:td
								0.5
							Element:tr
							Element:td
								Endpoint 'extraScore' property
							Element:td
								Defined Extra Score
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The defined Path and extraScore properties in the registerApiRest() method, help determine the score for any given Endpoint. The higher the score allows the API to determine which Endpoint is being used for a given request. For example, if you had extended the Accounts/:record GET API Endpoint as follows:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								/custom/modules/Accounts/clients/base/api/CustomAccountsApi.php
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								<?php if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point'); require_once("clients/base/api/ModuleApi.php"); class CustomAccountsApi extends ModuleApi { public function registerApiRest() { return array( //GET & POST 'getAccount' => array( //request type 'reqType' => array('GET'), //set authentication 'noLoginRequired' => false, //endpoint path 'path' => array('Accounts', '?'), //endpoint variables 'pathVars' => array('module', 'record'), //method to call 'method' => 'retrieveRecord', //short help string to be displayed in the help documentation 'shortHelp' => 'An example of a GET endpoint', //long help to be displayed in the help documentation 'longHelp' => 'custom/clients/base/api/help/MyEndPoint_MyGetEndPoint_help.html', ), ); } /** * Method to be used for my Accounts/:record endpoint */ public function retrieveRecord($api, $args) { //custom logic return parent::retrieveRecord($api,$args); } } ?>
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This Endpoint will be used when accessing Accounts/<record_id> since the Exact Match of Accounts in the path property gives a greater score than the <module> match that comes with the standard <module>/:record Endpoint defined in ModuleApi.

											Endpoint Versioning
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Part of the scoring calculation, allows for versioning of the API Endpoints to accommodate the same endpoint path in the Rest API, for other versions of the API. If you have a custom Endpoint at rest/v10/CustomEndpoint, and would like to alter the logic slightly for another use without deprecating or removing the old Endpoint, you can use the versioning techniques to have the new logic reside at rest/v11/CustomEndpoint. The following table describes how the Versioning properties on the Endpoint definition affect the score of the Endpoint to allow the API to determine which Endpoint should be used for a given request.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tbody
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:strong
											Property
										Element:td
										Element:strong
											Score
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											minVersion
										Element:td
											0.02 + minVersion/1000
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											maxVersion
										Element:td
											0.02
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											minVersion === maxVersion (i.e. Both minVersion and maxVersion properties are defined on Endpoint to the same value)
										Element:td
											0.06 + minVersion/1000
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											To allow for additional Versions in the API, you will first need to customize the 'maxVersion' property in the
										Element:code
											$apiSettings
											array. To do this, create the following file:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											./custom/include/api/metadata.php
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Inside the file you can set the
										Element:code
											$apiSettings['maxVersion']
											property as follows:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											<?php
										Element:br
										Element:br
											$apiSettings['maxVersion'] = 11;
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Once you have configured the Max Version property you can then set the minVersion and maxVersion properties on the Endpoint definition in the custom
										Element:code
											registerApiRest()
											method. For example, the following Endpoint definitions:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											<?php ... return array( 'foo1' => array( 'reqType' => 'GET', 'path' => array('Accounts','config', 'pathVars' => array('module', 'record'), 'method' => 'foo1', ), 'foo2' => array( 'reqType' => 'GET', 'minVersion' => 11, 'path' => array('Accounts','config', 'pathVars' => array('module', 'record'), 'method' => 'foo2', ), 'foo3' => array( 'reqType' => 'GET', 'minVersion' => 11, 'maxVersion' => 11, 'path' => array('Accounts','config', 'pathVars' => array('module', 'record'), 'method' => 'foo3', ), 'foo4' => array( 'reqType' => 'GET', 'minVersion' => 11, 'maxVersion' => 12, 'path' => array('Accounts','config', 'pathVars' => array('module', 'record'), 'method' => 'foo3', ), 'foo5' => array( 'reqType' => 'GET', 'minVersion' => 14, 'path' => array('Accounts','config', 'pathVars' => array('module', 'record'), 'method' => 'foo5', ), ); ...
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											With the above definitions the following table provides the Expected Request for each Endpoint.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
