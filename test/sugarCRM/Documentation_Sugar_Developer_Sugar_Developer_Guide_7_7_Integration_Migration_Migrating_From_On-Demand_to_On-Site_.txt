								Occasionally system administrators will have the need to deploy versions of their On-Demand instance to an On-Site system. Reasons for this type of deployment are:

								Before migrating Sugar to an On-Site environment, you will need to request a backup of your On-Demand system by
							Element:a
								filing a case
								with the Sugar Support team. Once the backup request is received, SugarCRM will provide an FTP account where the following files can be downloaded:
							Element:br
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								instance_name-YYYYMMDDHHmm.sql.gz (backup of database)
							Element:li
								instance_name-YYYYMMDDHHmm-triggers.sql.gz (backup of database triggers)
							Element:li
								instance_name-YYYYMMDDHHmm.files.tgz (backup of file system)
							Element:li
								The local system must be running MySQL. Converting the database to another system, such as SQL Server or Oracle, requires special handling. For more information regarding this type of conversion, please contact your Account Manager.
							Element:li
								On-Site system administrators must be familiar with their stack and the tools (gunzip, tar, mysqladmin, mysql, etc.) referenced in this guide.

							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Note
								: It is the system administrator's responsibility to diagnose and troubleshoot issues specific to the stack (permissions, environment variables, etc.).

								Deploy the backup files to a local system using the following steps:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:ol
							Element:li
								Extract and import the SQL data as follows:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Extract the SQL file via an archive utility (e.g. 7-Zip) or via command line such as:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								gunzip instance_name-YYYYMMDDHHmm.sql.gz
							Element:li
								Create a database on your MySQL server via command line:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
								Or, if already logged into MySQL, with a command such as:
							Element:code
								mysqladmin -u mysql_username -p create instance_name
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								CREATE DATABASE instance_name;
							Element:li
								Import the SQL data to your MySQL server via the command line:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								mysql -u mysql_username database_name -p < instance_name-YYYYMMDDHHmm.sql
							Element:li
								Extract the Triggers file via an archive utility (e.g. 7-Zip) or via command line such as:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								gunzip instance_name-YYYYMMDDHHmm.triggers.sql.gz
							Element:li
								Import the Triggers data to your MySQL server via the command line:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								mysql -u mysql_username database_name -p < instance_name-YYYYMMDDHHmm.triggers.sql
							Element:li
								Extract the
							Element:code
								tar
								file to your web server's web root directory (e.g. /var/www/html) with the following command:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
								This will create a directory named "instance_name-YYYYMMDDHHmm" in your web root directory.
							Element:code
								tar -C /var/www/html -xzf instance_name-YYYYMMDDHHmm.files.tgz
							Element:li
								Rename the newly created directory:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								mv /var/www/html/instance_name-YYYYMMDDHHmm /var/www/html/instance_name
							Element:li
								For Linux-based servers, perform the following actions:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Change the ownership of the directory to be accessible by the Apache user and group. Please note that the user and group (e.g.
							Element:code
								apache
								,
							Element:code
								www-data
								, etc.) values can vary depending on your web server configuration.
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/instance_name
							Element:li
								Change the permissions of the directory to ensure files can be accessed by the application. The actual permission values may differ depending on server security settings.
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								chmod -R 770 /var/www/html/instance_name
							Element:li
								Edit the
							Element:code
								config.php
								file to point to your database.
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Open the
							Element:code
								config.php
								file:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								vi /var/www/html/instance_name/config.php
							Element:li
								Locate and update the
							Element:code
								dbconfig
								array with the information appropriate for your MySQL server as follows:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								'dbconfig' => array ( 'db_host_name' => 'localhost', 'db_host_instance' => 'SQLEXPRESS', 'db_user_name' => 'mysql_username', 'db_password' => 'mysql_password', 'db_name' => 'instance_name', 'db_type' => 'mysql', 'db_port' => '', 'db_manager' => 'MysqliManager', ),
							Element:li
								Edit the
							Element:code
								config.php
								file and modify the following parameters:
							Element:ul
							Element:li
							Element:code
								site_url
								should be the URL of the instance on your server (e.g.
							Element:span
								https://www.mysugarinstance.com
								)
							Element:li
							Element:code
								host_name
								should be the URL of the instance without the https protocol (e.g. www.mysugarinstance.com)
							Element:li
								Modify the
							Element:code
								.htaccess
								file in the root directory of the instance.
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								Remove the following lines if they exist in the file:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								#Added by operations to force SSL RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !^entryPoint=WebToLeadCapture RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-SSL-CLUSTER} !^od2$ RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
							Element:li
								If your On-Site deployment does not reside in the root of your domain (e.g. https://www.example.com/mysugar/), change the following line from:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
								to:
							Element:code
								RewriteBase /
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								RewriteBase /mysugar/
							Element:li
								If you are migrating permanently to an On-Site deployment, there are additional modifications that should be made to ensure full functionality for your instance of Sugar.
							Element:ul
							Element:li
								To restore the ability to perform ad hoc file backups, open the
							Element:code
								./config.php
								file and remove the following line:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								'hide_admin_backup' => true,
							Element:li
								To restore the ability to perform upgrades, open the
							Element:code
								./config.php
								file and remove the following line:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								'disable_uw_upload' => true,
							Element:li
								To display the full text search configuration options under Admin > Search, open the
							Element:code
								./config.php
								file and remove the following line:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								'hide_full_text_engine_config' => true,
							Element:li
								To display the Sugar log settings under Admin > System Settings, open the
							Element:code
								./config.php
								file and remove the following line:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								'logger_visible' => false,
							Element:li
								To bypass security checks when installing packages via Admin > Module Loader, open the
							Element:code
								./config.php
								file and change the following line from:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
								to:
							Element:code
								'packageScan' => true,
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								'packageScan' => false,
							Element:li
								To ensure full-text search functions properly, open the
							Element:code
								./config.php
								file and modify the following lines to point to your
							Element:a
								ElasticSearch
								configuration:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								'full_text_engine' => array ( 'Elastic' => array ( 'host' => '<your_elastic_search_host>', 'port' => '<your_elastic_search_port>', ), ),
							Element:li
								Finally, please navigate to Admin > Repair and perform a "Quick Repair and Rebuild" to clear all cached elements from the On-Demand instance.
