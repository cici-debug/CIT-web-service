								Database
							Element:p
								All Sugar editions support the MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server databases. Sugar Enterprise and Sugar Ultimate also support the DB2 and Oracle databases. In general, Sugar uses only common database functionality, and the application logic is embedded in the PHP code. Sugar does not use database triggers or stored procedures. This design simplifies coding and testing across different database vendors. The only implementation difference across the various supported databases is column types.
