								How it Works

							Element:p
								As of 6.3.0, custom job functions can be created using the extension framework. The function for the job will be defined in ./custom/Extension/modules/Schedulers/Ext/ScheduledTasks/. Files in this directory are compiled into ./custom/modules/Schedulers/Ext/ScheduledTasks/scheduledtasks.ext.php and then included for use in ./modules/Schedulers/_AddJobsHere.php.

								Use the section below to introduce the technology in relation to the product and describe its benefits.

								This first step is to create your jobs custom key. For this example we will be using 'custom_job' as our job key.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								./custom/Extension/modules/Schedulers/Ext/ScheduledTasks/custom_job.php
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								<?php //add the job key to the list of job strings array_push($job_strings, 'custom_job'); function custom_job() { //custom job code //return true for completed return true; }
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Next, we will need to define our jobs label string:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								./custom/Extension/modules/Schedulers/Ext/Language/en_us.custom_job.php
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								<?php $mod_strings['LBL_CUSTOM_JOB'] = 'Custom Job';
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Finally, We will need to navigate to:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								Admin / Repair / Quick Repair and Rebuild
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once a Quick Repair and Rebuild has been run, the new job will be available for use when creating new schedulers in:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								Admin / Scheduler
