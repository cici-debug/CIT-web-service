								Understanding Sugar's Framework
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Designed as the most modern web-based CRM platform available today, Sugar has quickly become the business application standard for companies around the world. The Sugar application framework has a sophisticated extension model built into it, allowing developers to make significant customizations to the application in an upgrade-safe and modular manner. It is easy to modify the core files in the distribution; you should always check for an upgrade-safe way to make changes. Educating developers on how to make upgrade-safe customizations is one of the key goals of this Developer Guide. For more information on Sugar's structure, please review the
							Element:a
								architecture
								section.

											The SugarCRM Open Source Project
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											From the very beginning of the SugarCRM Open Source project in 2004, the SugarCRM development team designed the application's source code to be examined and modified by developers. SugarCRM's "Sugar Community Edition" product accepts contributions from the Sugar Community, but not all contributions are included because SugarCRM maintains high standards for code quality.

							Element:li
								Do not combine or use the Sugar products with any code that is licensed under a prohibited license (e.g., AGPL, GPL v3, Creative Commons or another similar license that would "taint" the Sugar products and require you to share the source code for this product with a third party).
