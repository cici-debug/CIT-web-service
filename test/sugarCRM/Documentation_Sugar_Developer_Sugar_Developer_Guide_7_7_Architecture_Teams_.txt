								Teams provide the ability to limit access at the record level, allowing sharing flexibility across functional groups. Developers can
							Element:a
								manipulate teams programmatically
								provided they understand Sugar's
							Element:a
								visibility framework
								.

								For more information on teams, please refer to the

											Table
										Element:td
										Element:strong
											Description
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											teams
										Element:td
											Each record in this table represents a team in the system.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											team_sets
										Element:td
											Each record in this table represents a unique team combination. For example, each user's private team will have a corresponding team set entry in this table. A team set may also be comprised of one or more teams.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											team_sets_teams
										Element:td
											The team_sets_teams table maintains the relationships to determine which teams belong to a team set. Each table that previously used the team_id column to maintain team security now uses the team_set_id column's value to associate the record to team(s).
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											team_sets_modules
										Element:td
											This table is used to manage team sets and keep track of which modules have records that are or were associated to a particular team set.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Never modify these tables without going through the PHP object methods. Manipuating the team sets with direct SQL may cause undesired side effects in the system due to how the validations and security methods work.

											Module Team Fields
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											In addition to the team tables, each module table also contains a
										Element:code
											team_id
											and
										Element:code
											team_set_id
											column. The
										Element:code
											team_set_id
											contains the id of a record in the
										Element:code
											team_sets
											table that contains the unique combination of teams associated with the record. The
										Element:code
											team_id
											will contain the id of the primary team designated for a record.

														Team Sets (team_set_id)
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														As mentioned above, Sugar implemented this feature not as a many-to-many relationship but as a one-to-many relationship. On each table that had a
													Element:code
														team_id
														field we added a 'team_set_id' field. We have also added a
													Element:code
														team_sets
														table, which maintains the
													Element:code
														team_set_id
														, and a
													Element:code
														team_sets_teams
														table, which relates a team set to the teams. When performing a team based query we use the 'team_set_id' field on the module table to join to
													Element:code
														team_sets_teams.team_set_id
														and then join all of the teams associated with that set. Given the list of teams from
													Element:code
														team_memberships
														we can then decide if the user has access to the record.

														Primary Team (team_id)
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The
													Element:code
														team_id
														is still being used, not only to support backwards compatibility with workflow and reports, but also to provide some additional features. When displaying a list, we use the team set to determine whether the user has access to the record. When displaying the data, we show the team from team id in the list. When the user performs a mouseover on that team, Sugar performs an Ajax call to display all of the teams associated with the record. This
													Element:code
														team_id
														field is designated as the Primary Team because it is the first team shown in the list, and for sales territory management purposes, can designate the team that actually owns the record and can report on it.

											Team Security
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											team_sets_teams
											table allows the system to check for permissions on multiple teams. The following diagram illustrates table relationships in SugarBean's
										Element:code
											add_team_security_where_clause
											method.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:img
									Node:
									(type) c

											Using the team_sets_teams table the system will determine which teams are associated with the
										Element:code
											team_set_id
											and then look in the
										Element:code
											team_memberships
											table for users that belong to the team(s).

											TeamSetLink
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Typically, any relationship in a class is handled by the
										Element:code
											data/Link2.php
											class. As a part of dynamic teams, we introduced the ability to provide your own custom Link class to handle some of the functionality related to managing relationships. The
										Element:code
											team_security
											parent vardefs in the Sugar objects contain the following in the 'teams' field definition:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											'link_class' => 'TeamSetLink', 'link_file' => 'modules/Teams/TeamSetLink.php',
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											link_class
											entry defines the class name we are using, and the
										Element:code
											link_file
											tells us where that class file is located. This class extends the legacy
										Element:code
											Link.php
											and overrides some of the methods used to handle relationships such as 'add' and 'delete'.

								Visibility Framework
							Element:p
								The visibility framework provides the capability to alter the queries Sugar uses to retrieve records from the database. This framework can allow for additional restrictions or specific logic to meet business requirements of hiding or showing only specific records. Visibility classes only apply to certain aspects of Sugar record retrieval, e.g. List Views, Dashlets, and Filter Lookups.
