											Module Links
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Module links are the top-level links for each available module, represented as tabs in the navigation bar (or, sometimes, the overflow menu). When a top-level link is clicked, the user is directed to the selected module's list view layout. These top-level links are also expandable elements that contain sub-navigation menu links, which are outlined in the following section.

														Module Action Links
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The module action links are displayed to the user when they click the down arrow next to amodule link. Module action extension files are located in
													Element:code
														./custom/Extension/modules/<module>/Ext/clients/base/menus/header/
														and compiled into
													Element:code
														./custom/modules/<module>/Ext/clients/base/menus/header/header.ext.php
														. By default, when you expand the sub-navigation links, you will see an element appear with the following options:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:ul
													Element:li
														Create {Module}
													Element:li
														List {Module}
													Element:li
														View {Module} Reports

														Adding Module Action Links
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The example below demonstrates how to add a module action link that points to the Leads module. To define your own module action link, you must create your own label extension for the link's display label:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														./custom/Extension/application/Ext/Language/en_us.addModuleLink.php
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														<?php //create the links label $app_strings['LNK_LEADS_C'] = 'View Leads';
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Now create the module action link extension:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														./custom/Extension/modules/<module>/Ext/clients/base/menus/header/addModuleLink.php
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														<?php $viewdefs['<module>']['base']['menu']['header'][] = array( 'route'=>'#Leads/', 'label' =>'LNK_LEADS_C', 'acl_module'=>'Leads', 'icon' => 'icon-user', );
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Once you have created the extension files, navigate to Admin > Repair > Quick Repair and Rebuild. This will append your profile action item to the existing list of links.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
													Element:strong
														Note:
														You may need to refresh the page to see the new profile menu items.

														Removing Module Action Links
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														To remove a module action link, loop through the list of module actions and remove the item by one of its properties. For your reference, the stock module actions can be found in
													Element:code
														./modules/<module>/clients/base/menus/header/header.php
														.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														./custom/Extension/modules/<module>/Ext/clients/base/menus/header/removeModuleLink.php
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														if (isset($viewdefs['<module>']['base']['menu']['header'])) { foreach ($viewdefs['<module>']['base']['menu']['header'] as $key => $moduleAction) { //remove the link by label key if ($moduleAction['label'] == "<link label key>") { unset($viewdefs['<module>']['base']['menu']['header'][$key]); } } }
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Once you have created the extension files, navigate to Admin > Repair > Quick Repair and Rebuild. This will remove the menu action item from the existing list of links.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
													Element:strong
														Note:

											Profile Action Links
									Node:

											Profile actions are the links listed under the user's profile menu on the right side of the MegaMenu. Profile action extension files are located in
										Element:code
											./custom/Extension/application/Ext/clients/base/views/profileactions/
											and are compiled into
										Element:code

														Adding Profile Action Links
												Node:
												(type) c

														The example below demonstrates how to add a profile action link to the Styleguide. To define your own profile action link, create your own label extension for the link's display label.
												Node:

														./custom/Extension/application/Ext/Language/en_us.addProfileActionLink.php
												Node:

													Element:code
														<?php //create the links label $app_strings['LNK_STYLEGUIDE_C'] = 'Styleguide';
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Next, create the profile action link extension:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														./custom/Extension/application/Ext/clients/base/views/profileactions/addProfileActionLink.php
												Node:
												(type) c

													Element:pre
													Element:code
														<?php $viewdefs['base']['view']['profileactions'][] = array( 'route' => '#Styleguide', 'label' => 'LNK_STYLEGUIDE_C', 'icon' => 'icon-link', );
												Node:
												(type) c

														Once you have created the extension files, navigate to Admin > Repair > Quick Repair and Rebuild. This will append your profile action item to the existing list of links.
