								Creating Custom Field Types
							Element:p
								In this example, we create a custom field type called "Highlightfield", which will mimic the base text field type with the added feature that the displayed text for the field will be highlighted in a color chosen when the field is created in Studio.

								Converting Address' Country Field to a Dropdown
							Element:p
								Address fields in Sugar® are normally text fields, which allow users to enter in the appropriate information (e.g. street, city, and country) for the record. However, with multiple users working in Sugar, it is possible for data (e.g. country) to be entered in a variety of different ways (e.g. USA, U.S.A, and United States) when creating or editing the record. This can cause some issues when creating a report grouped by the Billing Country field, for example, as records with the same country will be grouped separately based on the different ways the country was entered.
