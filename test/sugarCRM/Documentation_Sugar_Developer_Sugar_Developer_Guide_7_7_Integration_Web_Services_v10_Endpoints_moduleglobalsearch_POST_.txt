								This endpoint exposes the global search capability using solely the Elasticsearch backend as an alternative to the /search endpoint. This endpoint can be used with a long list of request arguments. Instead of using GET request arguments, all described arguments can be used inside a JSON encoded request body using a the GET request. If your client has no support for GET requests with a body, the POST method can be used as an alternative.

								The search expression. Multiple terms can be specified at once. All enabled fields will be searched in. The results are ordered by relevance which is based on a multitude of settings based on token counts, hit ratio, (weighted) boost values and type of field.

If no search expression is given results are returned based on last modified date.
