								The SugarField widgets, located in
							Element:code
								./include/SugarFields/Fields/
								, define the data formatting and search query structure for the various field types. They also define the rendering of fields for modules running in backward compatibility mode. When creating or overriding field widgets, developers should place their customization in
							Element:code
								./custom/include/SugarFields/Fields/
								. For information on how Sidecar renders fields, please refer to the
							Element:a
								fields
								section in our user interface documentation.

											Implementation
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											All fields for a module are defined within
										Element:a
											vardefs
											. Within this definition, the
										Element:code
											type
											attribute will determine all of the logic applied to the field. For example, the Contacts module has a 'Do Not Call' field. In the vardefs, this field is defined as follows:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											'do_not_call' => array ( 'name' => 'do_not_call', // the name of the field 'vname' => 'LBL_DO_NOT_CALL', // the label for the field name 'type' => 'bool', // the fields type 'default' => '0', // the fields default value 'audited'=>true, // whether the field is audited 'duplicate_on_record_copy' => 'always', // whether to duplicate the fields value when being copied 'comment' => 'An indicator of whether contact can be called' // admin context of the field ),
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											bool
											type field is rendered in the UI from the
										Element:code
											./clients/base/fields/bool/bool.js
										Element:a
											field
											controller which renders the appropriate
										Element:a
											handlebars
											template as defined by the users current view for sidecar enabled modules. When the user saves data, the controller formats the data for the API and passes it to an endpoint. Once the data is received by the server, The
										Element:code
											SugarField
											definition calls any additional logic in the
										Element:code
											apiSave
											function to format the data for saving to the database. The same concept is applied in the
										Element:code
											apiFormatField
											function when retrieving data from the database to be passed back to the user interface through the API. For modules running in backward compatibility mode, the
										Element:code
											bool
											field is rendered using the Smarty
										Element:code
											.tpl
											) templates located in
										Element:code
											./include/SugarFields/Fields/Bool/
											.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											While the vardefs define the default type for a field, this value can be overridden in the metadata of the view rendering the field. The example being that in
										Element:code
											./custom/modules/Contacts/clients/base/views/record/record.php
											, you can modify the
										Element:code
											do_not_call
											field array to point to a custom field type you have created. For more information on creating custom field types, please refer to
										Element:a
											Creating Custom Fields
											documentation.
