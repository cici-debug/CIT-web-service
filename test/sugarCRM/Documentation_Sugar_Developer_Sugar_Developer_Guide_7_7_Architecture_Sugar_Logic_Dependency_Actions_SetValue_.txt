								While the dependency metadata for your module can be defined in
							Element:code
								./modules/<module>/metadata/dependencydefs.php
								and
							Element:code
								./custom/modules/<module>/metadata/dependencydef.php
								, it is recommended to use the
							Element:a
								extension framework
								when customizing stock modules to prevent third party plugins from conflicting with your customizations. The following section will demonstrate how to implement a read-only dependency.

											For our example, we will create a dependency on the Leads module that will display the number of activities related to a Lead. Activities are composed of calls, meetings, tasks, notes, and emails. An example extension definition is shown below:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											./custom/Extension/modules/<module>/Ext/Dependencies/custom_phone_alternate.php
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											<?php $dependencies['Leads']['activity_count_dep'] = array( 'hooks' => array("edit", "view"), //not including save so that the value isn't stored in the DB 'trigger' => 'true', //Optional, the trigger for the dependency. Defaults to 'true'. 'onload' => true, //Whether or not to trigger the dependencies when the page is loaded 'actions' => array( array( 'name' => 'SetValue', 'params' => array( 'target' => 'activity_count_c', 'value' => 'add( count($notes), count($calls), count($emails), count($meetings), count($tasks) )' ) ) ) );
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Once you have the file in place, you will need to navigate to Admin > Repairs > and run a Quick Repair and Rebuild.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
										Element:strong
											Note
											: It is important that the module name is plural ('Cases' vs. 'Case') and that the name of the dependency, "activity_count_dep" in this example, is unique.

											You can also add as many actions as you need to the array. In the example below, we want to display our count value but prevent users from being able to edit the value. An example extension definition is shown below:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											<?php $dependencies['Leads']['number_of_cases_dep'] = array( 'hooks' => array("edit", "view"), //not including save so that the value isn't stored in the DB 'trigger' => 'true', //Optional, the trigger for the dependency. Defaults to 'true'. //'triggerFields' => array('status'), //unneeded for this example as its not field triggered 'onload' => true, 'actions' => array( array( 'name' => 'SetValue', 'params' => array( 'target' => 'activity_count_c', 'value' => 'add( count($notes), count($calls), count($emails), count($meetings), count($tasks) )' ) ), array( 'name' => 'ReadOnly', 'params' => array( 'target' => 'activity_count_c', 'value' => 'true', //Set to true instead of a formula because its always read-only ), ) ) );

											Dependencies in Field Definitions
									Node:

											Unlike several of the other dependencies,
										Element:code
											SetValue
											is built into Studio. So this dependency can be set as a custom vardef value or in the vardefs file of a custom module. If you wanted to add this dependency to an existing field then you can create a vardef extension such as
										Element:code
											./custom/Extension/modules/<module>/Ext/Vardefs/
											. An example extension definition is shown below:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											./custom/Extension/modules/Accounts/Ext/Vardefs/activity_count_c.php
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											<?php $dictionary['Lead']['fields']['activity_count_c']['options'] = 'numeric_range_search_dom'; $dictionary['Lead']['fields']['activity_count_2_c']['calculated'] = 'true'; $dictionary['Lead']['fields']['activity_count_2_c']['formula'] = 'add( count($calls), count($emails), count($meetings), count($notes), count($tasks) )'; $dictionary['Lead']['fields']['activity_count_2_c']['enforced'] = 'true'; $dictionary['Lead']['fields']['activity_count_2_c']['enable_range_search'] = '1';
