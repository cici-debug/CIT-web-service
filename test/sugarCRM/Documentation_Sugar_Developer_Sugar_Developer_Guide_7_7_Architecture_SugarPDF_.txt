								As of version 6.7.x, Sugar includes a Smarty template engine called PDF Manager. This allows administrators to create and manage templates for generated PDF files for any deployed module, custom or standard. The PDF Manager is available to only administrative users and can be accessed through Admin > PDF Manager.
							Element:br
								For more information on the PDF Manager, please refer to the
							Element:a
								PDF Manager
								documentation in the Administration guide.

								Key PDF Classes

									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:h3
											TCPDF
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Sugar uses the
										Element:a
											TCPDF
											4.6.013 library, located in
										Element:code
											./vendor/tcpdf/
											, as the core engine to generate PDFs. This library is extended by
										Element:a
											Sugarpdf
											which is used by the core application to generate PDFs.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:h3
											Sugarpdf
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											Sugarpdf
											class, located in
										Element:code
											./include/Sugarpdf/Sugarpdf.php
											, extends the
										Element:a
											TCPDF
											class. Within this class, we have overridden certain functions to integrate sugar features. Some key methods that were overridden are listed below:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tbody
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:strong
											Method
										Element:td
										Element:strong
											Description
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											Header
										Element:td
											Overridden to enable custom logos.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											SetFont
										Element:td
											Overridden to allow for the loading of custom fonts. The custom fonts direction is defined by the
										Element:code
											K_PATH_CUSTOM_FONTS
											var. By default, this value is set to
										Element:code
											./custom/vendor/tcpdf/fonts/
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											Cell
										Element:td
											Overridden to apply the prepare_string() function. This allows for the ability to clean the string before sending to PDF.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Some key additional methods that were added are listed below:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:table
										Element:tbody
										Element:tr
										Element:td
										Element:strong
											Method
										Element:td
										Element:strong
											Description
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											predisply
										Element:td
											Preprocessing before the display method is called. Is intended to setup general PDF document properties like margin, footer, header, etc.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											display
										Element:td
											Performs the actual PDF content generation. This is where the logic to display output to the PDF should be placed.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											process
										Element:td
											Calls predisplay and display.
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											writeCellTable
										Element:td
											Method to print a table using the cell print method of TCPDF
										Element:tr
										Element:td
											writeHTMLTable
										Element:td
											Method to print a table using the writeHTML print method of TCPDF
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Custom PDF classes that extend
										Element:code
											Sugarpdf
											can be located in the following directories:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											./include/Sugarpdf/sugarpdf/sugarpdf.<pdf view>.php
										Element:li
											./modules/<module>/sugarpdf/sugarpdf.<pdf view>.php
										Element:li
											./custom/modules/<module>/sugarpdf/sugarpdf.<pdf view>.php
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											PDF Manager classes that extend
										Element:code
											Sugarpdf
											are located in the following directories:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											./include/Sugarpdf/sugarpdf/sugarpdf.smarty.php
										Element:li
											./include/Sugarpdf/sugarpdf/sugarpdf.pdfmanager.php
										Element:li
											./custom/include/Sugarpdf/sugarpdf/sugarpdf.pdfmanager.php
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Each extended class will define a specific PDF view that is accessible with the following URL parameters:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											module=<module>
										Element:li
											action=sugarpdf
										Element:li
											sugarpdf=<pdf view>
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Within each custom PDF class, the display method will need to be redefined. If you would like, It is also possible to override other methods like
										Element:code
											Header
											. The process method of this class will be called from
										Element:a
											ViewSugarpdf
											. When a PDF is being generated, the most relevant
										Element:code
											sugarpdf.<pdf action>.pdf
											class is determined by the
										Element:a
											SugarpdfFactory
											.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:h3
											ViewSugarpdf
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											ViewSugarpdf
											class, located in
										Element:code
											./include/MVC/View/views/view.sugarpdf.php
											, is used to create the SugarViews that generate PDFs. These views can be found and/or created in one of the following directory paths:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											./modules/<module>/views/view.sugarpdf.php
										Element:li
											./custom/modules/<module>/views/view.sugarpdf.php
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											SugarViews can be called by navigating to a URL in the format of:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											http://<url>/index.php?module=<module>&action=sugarpdf&sugarpdf=<pdf action>
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											As of 6.7, PDFs are mainly generated using the PDF Manager templating system. To generate the PDF stored in the PDF Manager, you would call a URL in the format of:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											http://<url>/index.php?module<module>&record=<record id>&action=sugarpdf&sugarpdf=pdfmanager&pdf_template_id=<template id>
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:h3
											SugarpdfFactory
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:a
											ViewSugarpdf
											class uses the
										Element:code
											SugarpdfFactory
											class, located in
										Element:code
											./include/Sugarpdf/SugarpdfFactory.php
											, to find the most relevant
										Element:code
											sugarpdf.<pdf action>.pdf
											class which generates the PDF document for a given PDF view and module. If one is not found, then the core
										Element:code
											Sugarpdf
											class is used.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The
										Element:code
											SugarpdfFactory
											class loads the first class found for the specified PDF action as determined by the following order:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											./custom/modules/<module>/sugarpdf/sugarpdf.<pdf view>.php
										Element:li
											./modules/<module>/sugarpdf/sugarpdf.<pdf view>.php
