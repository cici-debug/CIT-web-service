								After upgrading your instance to Sugar 7.x, some custom modules may be left in the legacy backward compatible format. This is normally due to the module containing a custom view or file that Sugar does not recognize as being a supported customization for Sidecar. To get your module working with Sidecar, you will need to remove the unsupported customization and run the
							Element:code
								UpgradeModule.php
								script.

								Note:
								The following commands should be run on a sandbox instance before being applied to any production environment. It is also important to note that this script should only be run against custom modules. Stock modules in backward compatibility should remain in backward compatibility.

								To upgrade a custom module, identify the module's unique key. This key can be easily found by identifying the module's folder name in
							Element:code
								./modules/<module key name>/
								. The module's key name will be in the format of
							Element:code
								abc_module
								.
							Element:li
								Next, change to the
							Element:code
								./modules/UpgradeWizard/
								path relative to your Sugar root directory in your terminal or command line application:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
								cd <sugar root>/modules/UpgradeWizard/
							Element:li
								Run the
							Element:code
								UpgradeModule.php
								script, passing in the sugar root directory and the unique key of the legacy module:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
								php UpgradeModule.php <sugar root> <module key>
								An example is shown below:
							Element:br
							Element:pre
								php UpgradeModule.php /var/www/html/sugarcrm/ abc_module
							Element:li
								The script with then output a series of messages identifying issues that need to be corrected. Once the issues have been addressed, you can then run the
							Element:code
								UpgradeModule.php
								script again to confirm no errors have been found.
							Element:li
								Once completed, log into your instance and navigate to Admin > Repair > Quick Repair and Rebuild. Test the custom module to ensure it is working as expected. There is no guarantee that the module will be fully functional in Sidecar and may therefore require additional development effort to ensure compatibility.
