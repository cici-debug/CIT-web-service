								Overview
						Node:

							Element:p
								The Handlebars library, located in
							Element:code
								./sidecar/lib/handlebars/
								, is a JavaScript library that lets Sugar create semantic templates. Handlebars help render content for
							Element:a
								layouts
								,
							Element:a
								views
								, and
							Element:a
								fields
								for Sidecar. Using Handlebars, you can make modifications to the display of content such as adding HTML or CSS.
						Node:
						(type) c

							Element:p
								For more information on the Handlebars library, please refer to their website at
							Element:a
								http://handlebarsjs.com
								.

								The Handlebars templates are stored in the filesystem as .hbs files. These files are stored along with the view, layout, and field metadata and are loaded according to the inheritance you have selected in your controller. To view the list of available templates, or to see if a custom-created template is available, you can open your browser's console window and inspect the
							Element:code
								Handlebars.templates
								namespace.

														When working with Handlebar templates, it can be difficult to identify where an issue is occurring or what a variable contains. To assist with troubleshooting this, you can use the log helper. The log helper will output the contents of
													Element:code
														this
														and the variable passed to it in your browsers console.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														This is an example of using log in an HBS template:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														{{log this}}

											Helpers
									Node:

										Element:p
											Handlebar Helpers are a way of adding custom functionality to the templates. Helpers are located in the following places:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
										Element:code
											./sidecar/src/view/hbs-helpers.js
											: Sidecar uses these helpers by default
										Element:li
										Element:code
											./include/javascript/sugar7/hbs-helpers.js
											: Additional helpers used by the base client
										Element:li
										Element:code
											./jssource/src_files/include/javascript/sugar7/hbs-helpers.js
											: The un-minified version of the base-client helpers

											Creating Helpers
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											When working with Handlebar templates, you may need to create your helper. To do this, follow these steps:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ol
										Element:li
											Create a Handlebars helper file in the
										Element:code
											./custom/
											directory. For this example, we will create two functions to convert a string to uppercase or lowercase:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											./custom/JavaScript/my-handlebar-helpers.js
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											/** * Handlebars helpers. * * These functions are to be used in handlebars templates. * @class Handlebars.helpers * @singleton */ (function(app) { app.events.on("app:init", function() { /** * convert a string to upper case */ Handlebars.registerHelper("customUpperCase", function (text) { return text.toUpperCase(); }); /** * convert a string to lower case */ Handlebars.registerHelper("customLowerCase", function (text) { return text.toLowerCase(); }); }); })(SUGAR.App);
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ol
										Element:li
											Next, create a JSGrouping extension in
										Element:code
											./custom/Extension/application/Ext/JSGroupings/
											. Name the file uniquely for your customization. For this example, we will create:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											./custom/Extension/application/Ext/JSGroupings/my-handlebar-helpers.php
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											<?php //Loop through the groupings to find include/javascript/sugar_grp7.min.js foreach ($js_groupings as $key => $groupings) { foreach ($groupings as $file => $target) { if ($target == 'include/javascript/sugar_grp7.min.js') { //append the custom helper file $js_groupings[$key]['custom/JavaScript/my-handlebar-helpers.js'] = 'include/javascript/sugar_grp7.min.js'; } break; } }
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:ol
										Element:li
											Finally, navigate to Admin > Repair and perform the following two repair sequences to include the changes:
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											Quick Repair and Rebuild
										Element:li
											Rebuild JS Groupings.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You can now call your custom helpers in the HBS files by using:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											{{customUpperCase "MyString"}} {{customLowerCase "MyString"}}
									Node:
									(type) c
