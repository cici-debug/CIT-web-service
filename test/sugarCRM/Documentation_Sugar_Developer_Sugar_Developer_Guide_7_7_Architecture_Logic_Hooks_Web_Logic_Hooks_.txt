								Overview
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Web logic hooks let administrators post record and event information to a specified URL when certain sugar events take place.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The administration panel for web logic hooks can be found by navigating to Admin > Web Logic Hooks in the Sugar application. When a web logic hook is triggered, Sugar creates a record in the
							Element:a
								job queue
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
							Element:strong
								Note:
								You must have the cron set up and running in order to process the job queue for web logic hooks. The POST of the information to the external URL will happen when the cron runs and not when the actual event occurs.
