								What Is REST?
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								REST stands for 'Representational State Transfer'. As of 7.x, REST is a core component of Sugar that defines how all information is exchanged within the application. This v10 API is separate from the v2-v4_1 REST APIs in that it has been rebuilt with the latest REST standards. Most functionality in the system, whether fetching or posting data, is interacting with the API in some way.

											How to Access the v10 REST Service
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											The base endpoint for the v10 REST service can be found at:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
											http://<site_url>/rest/v10/
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											For your reference, all v10 endpoints can be found by navigating to
										Element:code
											http://<site_url>/rest/v10/help
											. Once you have identified your instances base endpoint, we can begin by authentication.

								Authentication
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Sugar 7 uses two-legged OAuth2 for authentication. You simply need to do a POST to
							Element:code
								/rest/v10/oauth2/token
								with the following parameters:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:table
							Element:tbody
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:strong
								grant_type
							Element:td
								String
							Element:td
								Type of request. Available grant types are "password" and "refresh_token".
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:strong
								client_id
							Element:td
								String
							Element:td
								The client_id of "sugar" will automatically create an OAuth Key in the system and can be used for "password" authentication. The client_id of "support_portal" will create an OAuth Key if the portal system is enabled and will allow for portal authentication. Other client_id's can be created by the administrator in the OAuthKeys section in the Administration section and can be used in the future for additional grant types, if the client secret is filled in, it will be checked to validate use of the client id.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:strong
								client_secret
							Element:td
								String
							Element:td
								The clients secret key.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:strong
								username
							Element:td
								String
							Element:td
								The username of the user authenticating to the system.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:strong
								password
							Element:td
								String
							Element:td
								The plaintext password the user authenticating to the system.
							Element:tr
							Element:td
							Element:strong
								platform
							Element:td
								String
							Element:td
								Defaults to "base" allows you to have custom meta-data per platform
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								First, we are going to login using a
							Element:code
								grant_type
								of "password" and a
							Element:code
								platform
								of "custom". Normally, when logging into Sugar, users login with a
							Element:code
								platform
								type of "base". We are using "custom" to avoid any potential
							Element:a
								login conflicts
								.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								curl -X POST -H Cache-Control:no-cache -d '{ "grant_type":"password", "client_id":"sugar", "client_secret":"", "username":"<username>", "password":"<password>", "platform":"custom" }' http:/<site_url>/rest/v10/oauth2/token
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Once you get the response you'll need to hold onto the
							Element:code
								access_token
								and the
							Element:code
								refresh_token
								. Anytime the
							Element:code
								access_token
								is invalidated, you'll want to make another request to the token endpoint with a
							Element:code
								grant_type
								of "refresh_token". Store just the
							Element:code
								refresh_token
								in long term storage – not the username and password. The response from the server will be as follows:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
							Element:code
								{ "access_token": "5ee48ec7-023e-ecff-5184-530bd0358868", "expires_in": 3600, "token_type": "bearer", "scope": null, "refresh_token": "5f197357-0167-f7a6-7912-530bd03275b6", "refresh_expires_in": 1209600, "download_token": "5f531625-e301-e3ea-1b11-530bd098be41" }

								Avoiding Login Conflicts
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Login conflicts often occur when building integrations or running data migrations with the
							Element:code
								platform
								of "base" or any other client type that is in use. This is due to the fact that Sugar uses the same REST API to power all the various clients such as Sugar, Portal, Mobile, and even the Outlook Plugin. Due to this, you need to let the API know you aren't conflicting with another client that may be in use. The way to accomplish this is the
							Element:code
								/rest/v10/oauth2/token
								call by changing the
							Element:code
								platform
								parameter to something other than "base", "mobile", or "portal". It is best to name it something that describes and identifies your current integration.

											Date Handling
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Date and date time inputs should be formatted following the ISO 8601 format. If the time zone is not included in a request, Sugar will assume the time zone of the user making the request.
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Filter on a specific date:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											{"date_start": "2015-08-12"}
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Filter on a date keyword using $dateRange:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											{"date_start": {"$dateRange": "today"}}
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											Filter on date range using manual time zones:
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:pre
										Element:code
											{"date_start": {"$dateBetween": ["2015-09-10T00:00:00+10:00","2015-09-10T23:59:59+10:00"]}}
