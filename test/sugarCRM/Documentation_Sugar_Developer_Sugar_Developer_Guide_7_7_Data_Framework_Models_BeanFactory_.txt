								The BeanFactory class, located in
							Element:code
								./data/BeanFactory.php
								, is used for loading an instance of a
							Element:a
								SugarBean
								. This class should be used any time you are creating or retrieving bean objects. It will automatically handle any classes required for the bean.

														newBean()
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														To create a new, empty SugarBean, use the
													Element:code
														newBean()
														method. This method is typically used when creating a new record for a module or to call properties of the module's bean object.
												Node:

														getBean()
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The getBean() method can be used to retrieve a specific record from the database. If a record id is not passed, a new bean object will be created.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														$bean = BeanFactory::getBean($module, $record_id);
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
													Element:strong
														Note
														: Disabling row-level security when accessing a bean should be set to true only when it is absolutely necessary to bypass security, for example when updating a Lead record from a custom Entry Point. An example of accessing the bean while bypassing row security is:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														$bean = BeanFactory::getBean($module, $record_id, array('disable_row_level_security' => true));

														retrieveBean()
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The
													Element:code
														retrieveBean()
														method can also be used to retrieve a specific record from the database. The difference between this method and
													Element:code
														getBean()
														is that null will be returned instead of an empty bean object if the retrieve fails.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														$bean = BeanFactory::retrieveBean($module, $record_id);

														getObjectName()
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The
													Element:code
														getObjectName()
														method will return the object name / dictionary key for a given module. This is normally the same as the bean name, but may not be for some modules such as Cases which has a key of 'aCase' and a name of 'Case'.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code

														getBeanName()
												Node:
												(type) c

														The

												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														$moduleClass = BeanFactory::getBeanName($module);
