								PHP Profiling
							Element:p
								As of the 6.6.2 release, Sugar introduced the ability to profile via XHProf, which is an easy-to-use, hierarchical profiler for PHP. This allows developers to better manage and understand customer performance issues introduced by their customizations. This tool enables quick and accurate identification of the sources of performance sinks within the code by generating profiling logs. Profiling gives you the ability to see the call stack for the entire page load with timing details around function and method calls as well as statistics on call frequency.
