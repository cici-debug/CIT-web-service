								Uploads
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The upload directory is used to store any files uploaded to Sugar. By default, anything uploaded to Sugar is stored in the
							Element:code
								./upload/
								directory. You can change this directory by updating the
							Element:a
								upload_dir
								configuration variable. Once uploaded, the file will be stored in this directory with a GUID name.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You should note that when uploading files to Sugar, there are three file size limits to configure. The first two limits are your PHP upload_max_filesize and post_max_size which are configured in your php.ini. The second limit is the sugar configuration setting for
							Element:a
								upload_maxsize
								, which will restrict the upload limit from within Sugar. This setting can also be modified in the application via Admin > System Settings. The smallest of these three values will be honored when an oversized file has been uploaded.
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								You should note that the PHP-defined file size settings and the upload directory cannot be modified for instances hosted on On-Demand.

											Upload Extensions
									Node:

										Element:p
											By default, several extension types are restricted due to security issues. Any files uploaded with these extensions will have '.txt' appended to it. The restricted extensions are listed below:
									Node:

									(layer)3
										Element:ul
										Element:li
											php
										Element:li

											js
										Element:li
											vbs
										Element:li
											html
										Element:li
											htm
									Node:
									(type) c
									(layer)3
										Element:p
											You can add or remove extensions to this list by modifying sugar configuration setting for
										Element:a
											upload_badext
											. You should note that this setting cannot be modified for instances hosted on On-Demand.

								How Files Are Stored
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:h4
														Note Attachments
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														When a file is uploaded to Sugar attached to a note, the file will be moved to the upload directory with a GUID name matching that of the notes id. The attributes of the file, such as filename and file_mime_type, will be stored in the note record.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The SQL to fetch information about a notes attachment is shown below:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														SELECT filename, file_mime_type FROM notes;
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:h4
														Email Attachments
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Email attachments are stored the same way as note attachments. When an email is imported to Sugar, the file will be moved to the upload directory with a GUID file name matching that of the notes id. The attributes of the file, such as filename and file_mime_type, will be stored in the note record and the note will have a parent_type of 'Emails'. This relates the attachment to the emails content.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The SQL to fetch information about an emails attachment is shown below:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														SELECT filename, file_mime_type FROM notes INNER JOIN emails ON notes.parent_type = 'Emails' AND notes.parent_id = emails.id INNER JOIN emails_text ON emails.id = emails_text.email_id;
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:h4
														Picture Fields
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Picture fields will upload the image to the upload directory with a GUID name and store the GUID in the database field on the record. An example of picture field can be found on the Contacts module.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														For a contact, the id of the picture attachment can be found with the SQL below:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														SELECT picture FROM contacts;
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:h4
														Document Attachments
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Files uploaded to Sugar as documents will be moved to the upload directory with a GUID name matching the document revision id. The document revision ID can be found in the document_revision_id field on the documents table. This field maps to the id field on the document_revisions table. The attributes of the file, such as filename and file_mime_type, are stored in the document revision record.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The SQL to fetch information about a documents attachment is shown below:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														SELECT filename, file_mime_type, file_ext FROM document_revisions INNER JOIN documents ON documents.id = document_revisions.document_id;
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:h4
														Knowledge Base Attachments
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														When working with the Knowledge Base, files and images attached to the form before the record is saved are uploaded and stored in the upload directory with the name
													Element:code
														<GUID><File Name>
														using the KbdocAttachments action found in
													Element:code
														./modules/KBDocuments/KbdocAttachments.php
														. Once the record is saved, these files are copied and saved in the upload directory with a GUID name matching that of the document revision id.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The SQL to fetch information about a knowledge base attachment is shown below:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														SELECT document_revisions.filename, document_revisions.file_mime_type, document_revisions.file_ext FROM document_revisions INNER JOIN kbdocument_revisions ON document_revisions.id = kbdocument_revisions.document_revision_id INNER JOIN kbdocuments ON kbdocument_revisions.kbdocument_id = kbdocuments.id;

														Module Loadable Packages
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														Module Loader packages are stored in the system differently than other uploads. They are uploaded to the ./upload/upgrades/module/ directory with their original file name. The details of the package, such as installation status and description, are stored in the upgrade_history table.
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														The SQL to fetch information about an installed package is shown below:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:pre
													Element:code
														SELECT * FROM upgrade_history;

														CSV Imports
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:p
														When importing records into Sugar, the most recent uploaded CSV file is stored in the upload directory as
													Element:code
														IMPORT_<module>_<user id>
														. Once the import has been run, the results of the import are stored in
													Element:code
														./upload/import/
														directory using a predefined format using the current users id. The files created will be as follows:
												Node:
												(type) c
												(layer)4
													Element:ul
													Element:li
													Element:strong
														dupes_<user id>.csv
														: The list of duplicate records found during the import
													Element:li
													Element:strong
														dupesdisplay_<user_id>.csv
														: The HTML formatted CSV for display to the user after import
													Element:li
													Element:strong
														error_<user id>.csv
														: The list of errors encountered during the import
													Element:li
													Element:strong
														errorrecords_<user_id>.csv
