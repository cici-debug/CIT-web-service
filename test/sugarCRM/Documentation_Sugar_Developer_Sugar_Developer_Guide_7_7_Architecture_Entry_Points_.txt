								Entry points, defined in

								./include/MVC/Controller/entry_point_registry.php
								, were used to ensure that proper security and authentication steps are applied consistently across the entire application. While they are still used in some areas of Sugar, any developers using custom entry points should adjust their customizations to use the latest

								instead.

								Accessing Entry Points
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								Available custom entry points can be accessed using a URL pattern as follows:
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:pre
								http://{sugar url}/index.php?entryPoint={entry point name}
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								The entry point name will be the specified index in the $entry_point_registry array. Access to this entry point outside of sugar will be dependent on the auth parameter defined in the $entry_point_registry array as well. More information on creating custom entry points can be found here and here.

								Creating Custom Entry Points
							Element:p
								As of 6.3.x, entry points can be created using the extension framework. The entry point extension directory, located at ./custom/Extension/application/Ext/EntryPointRegistry/, is compiled into ./custom/application/Ext/EntryPointRegistry/entry_point_registry.ext.php after a Quick Repair and Rebuild. Additional information can be found in the extensions EntryPointRegistry section.
