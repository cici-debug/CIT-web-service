					The
				Element:strong
					Ghana Stock Exchange API
					(GSE-API) is a web-based application programming interface aimed at providing real-time Ghana Stock Exchange market data for websites and other computer applications. The API is designed for individual developers who wish to integrate and use the Ghana Stock Exchange market data inside their own custom-developed applications. The API's stock data coverage includes daily end-of-day prices for all current symbols on the Ghana Stock Exchange, share dividends, earnings per share, shares outstanding, market capitalization, company profile, and more. All of this data is available via a single, uniform, easy-to-use API platform.

				Element:p
					GSE-API is fast, reliable, and very secure. It can be used to implement a live stream of market data on a website, build a stock monitoring mobile app, or a daily end-of-day market summary service via SMS. All requested data are delivered to the API client via redundant, load-balanced servers in order to answer requests quickly and in timely fashion. Additionally, to save bandwidth footprint for API requests, all responses are efficiently compressed and sent to the client without sacrificing performance or introducing unwarranted network latency. Finally, use of GSE-API is completely free and unencumbered for everyone; no registration is required—and so it will ever remain.

				Element:p
					The GSE-API's request endpoint is this page,
				Element:code
					https://dev.kwayisi.org/apis/gse
					. Currently, the response data is available only in
				Element:abbr
					JSON
					and
				Element:abbr
					JSONP
					formats. However, support for
				Element:abbr
					XML
					and other data formats is being considered. When launching a request, you may append a
				Element:code
					prettify
					query string parameter to the
				Element:abbr
					URL
					to get the response in a human readable layout. (For example,
				Element:code
					https://dev.kwayisi.org/apis/gse/live?prettify
					.) One noteworthy thing to mention is that, although some properties of the API objects are stated to be of the type "float," their values may sometimes
				Element:em
					appear
					as integers, i.e., without decimal places. This may be resolved in due time.
