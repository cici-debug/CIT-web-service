								GET /{currency}
						Node:
						(type) c
						(layer)2
							Element:p
								This API resource returns a
							Element:a
								currency
								object representing the currency information and live exchange rates for
							Element:span
								{currency}
								against a selected list of currencies, namely, USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, and CHF. If the exchange rate of the specified currency against one of the selected currencies is less than 1.0000, the pairing is reversed with the specified currency becoming the counter currency instead. You may, however, disable this behavior by appending the query string parameter
							Element:code
								fixed
								to the request. If the specified currency is not found, an HTTP 404 status response is triggered.
